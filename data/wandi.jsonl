Why then there still be so many people who prefer to drive their own car instead of seat comfortably on the train or on the tube reading their favorite book on their way to work ? I would say that this is because the public transport are not so efficient as the should do. \n\nIn my town for example, I have been Waiting for up to forty minutes before I could take a bus. I strongly believe that it is a shame because a lot of people like me would live their vehicles at home and take a train instead.\n\nSecondly , the environment would improve its state indeed, as far as I can see the pollution caused by the traffic is ruining monuments and making the air dirty and heavy, the same is as far as waste of time is concerned, obviously the fewer cars are around the quicker you can get where you want.\n\nIn conclusion I would really like that politicians who care about public transport will improve the services so that more people could leave their vehicles at home and move around much more easily.\n","word_count":262}

When people are avaible to tavel to other continents or far away, they may need a plane, wicth is a public transport, to complete the journey because the have tu cross oceans and clomplicated distances that have different landforms.\n\n      However, a car is something witch is from the person and he can do wathever he wants and find it in the same way he or she left it, and sometimes public sports arent left in the best way. In addiion, you have to share with people you absolutely dont know and probably wont see again. Consequesntly yo can be stole or get sick. But, by obseving all these people you can rich yourself with different cultures and manners the other have and incorporate new topics.\n\n       To conclude we can establish a middle point. Public sports are useful but sometimes inconvenient but more cheaper. You can get to know new people and different cultures.\n","word_count":263}

If the war or other dangerous threat the safety of country\uff0cthey can not get help from other countries immediately. Therefore\uff0cpeople accept military service could be easier to protect their country.

{"index":194597,"grade":"A","full_text":"Recently, an increasing number of people try to travel by car for convenient. In my opinion, public transport will still exist in the society. There are three main reasons for supporting my idea. Firstly, for the long-distance, the car is not as convenient as airport. for example, if you go to another city by car, you may spent more than two days on the way. On the contrary, airport just cost your two hours, and you can go to your destination. The time spending of taking airport is lower than taking car. Secondly, consuming car is not a normal thing for part of developing or undeveloped country. The fee of buying car and fuel oil is expensive for poor people. Thus, it is important to use public transport because it is much cheaper than private car, and everyone can consume.Thirdly, the global warming is a serious issue for human who live in the earth. Air pollution is the main causes for global warming. The great number of using private car leads to higher level of air pollution, and the public transport is one of the best solutions for decreasing the air pollution. To sum up, there are numerous benefits to use public transport, and it will not disappear. \n","word_count":208}

Firstly it'll allow young people to have a rest after the first hard-work studying period. Ten or eleven years at school make them tired, in spite of pupils don't notice it. But choosing the second education is very important step, which need serious attitude. Secondly such year off would give to future students a chance to try themselves in new professional sphears. Also they would have an opprtunity being involved in volontier activity. And thirdly they might work for earning own money or travel. This year holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and gettin new power for future education.\nOne year is not long period. But benefits after year off will be obvious.\n\n","word_count":188}

Also travelling, of course, that's a big part of the function of the car! The very well developed highways, roads, city streets provide a good foundation for the cars, look at the North America, the highways were developed anywhere, it's really your own lose if you don't drive a car, drive on them(highways)\n\nSecond, Human start to learn driving at the age of 16, and they can master the driving skills very quickly( within a month or two), soon they can drive to wherever they want to go, and we also see people at the age of 80 still drive to their destinations as they got used to it. so who care to bother taking the public transportation anymore?  \n\nThird, The public transportation sucks, when you think about it, you can picture the crowded subways, dirty buses, and the difficulty\/hussults between the public transportation transfer in your mind. The wasted time also should weight in, whether it is waiting for the trains, or waiting for the delayed buses, not to mention the longer time it takes compared to travelling in a car. And driving your own car can be very convenient too, it can right come to your own garage.\n\nAll in all, Public transport is not as fast as a car can be; it's not as convenient as a car can provide, so it's future is in doubt.\n\n\n","word_count":279}

The cars need to be repaired; besides, if you have a car, you have to pay some taxes. In addition, these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city.\n\nSecondly, another reason is the global warming because the atmosphere is much polluted.

After he got the reason why I didn't have any desire to play, he told me to give myself a try, and if I still didn't like it, he would't force me. Then, he taught me how to play, for example, when hitting, used the strength of the whole arm and did not just used elbow, or you would feel tired shortly.\n  While playing, I rejoiced at this exercise, because I have never sweated so much and felt refreshed before. The funniest thing to me was that I thought I were a kid who studied kindergarten for the way he taught. When hitting ball back successfully, he would say ''good, keep going or you did it''. Hitting ball again and again, I learned I loved badminton unconsciously, which not only includes running but also concentrating.\n  Badminton is an easy sport that everyone can try , just focus on ball and hit it back.

An example of that is the marriage of homosexual  where some state admit this marriage, others don't  .\n Also, the reading passage declares  that even the federal government  let each state function independently, it still control on the main decisions . this case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of federal government to stop illegal immigration to USA through Nevada desert . also the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the state and the federal blame each other in the increase of the unemployment in some states\nIn conclusion, federal government which give freedom and powerful, cause many problems such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility .\n\n","word_count":433}
{"index":103696,"grade":"B","full_text":"His name is Mohamed but he is normally called Franco, an easier name to use in Italy, the Country where he is working. Mohamed is from Senegal, 33 years old, graduated in education with a master in education for children and people with special needs. He completed his studies six years ago but since then he was unable to find a proper employment in his Country. Therefore, he decided to migrate looking for better job opportunities. After a complex and difficult journey, Mohamed managed to reach the Italian coasts in 2011.Helped by a Senegalese community, he has eventually found a  job as a fruit seller in a local market. Despite his high qualified studies in education, Mohamed had to carry on a job in a completely different field.\nThe phenomenon of immigration of people from Africa to Europe seeking better opportunities has become common in the last  decades. However, nowadays even in the rich Western Europe, many highly qualified European graduates struggle to find an employment. This has become a challenging issue that is leading most of them to start the same immigration pattern followed by Mohamed towards other Countries.\nUnlike the post-War society, where the European economy was booming, since more than 5 years, Europe is suffering from a profound economic crisis whose major effects are borne by the youths, including the highly qualified graduates.\nSuch a phenomenon is also worsened by the education curriculum adopted in many schools, which has failed to adapt to the changes brought in the society by globalization. Schools and job markets are often separated like two different worlds. Therefore, once graduated, qualified youths find themselves to face both the economic crisis and a hostile job market.\nI believe that Governments from different Countries should come together to find appropriate measures to overcome the economic crisis and stop the vicious circle that leads qualified people to be excluded from the job market and, therefore, contribute to worsen the impact of the economic crisis.\n\n","word_count":329}

Simultaneously, some sources contended pornography and violent information which make many people afraid of using internet to search information.

I also recommend going to the vaults under the cathedral, where since the 16th century many kings and famous Polish people have their graves. The Wawel Royal Castle is an obligatory place to see, while visiting Poland. It is well known in the whole of Europe and many foreigners are coming to Poland just to see the Cracow city and among other things the Wawel Castle. I also thoroughly recommend Cracow in general as a place to visit, because it is beautiful, full of other worth-seeing monuments, cute small cafes, various choice of restaurants and vivid hotels with great views on the riverside.

There are less people who use the public transport in the city because they prefer travelling by car rather than in public transport.For this reason, the use of public transport is going down, and some experts say that there is no future for the public transport.\n\nFor lot of people, travel by your own car is more comfortable than travel by public transport like bus or metro, because you do not depend on a schedule, that it is very common when you take public transport. Conversely, when you travel by your own car, you save a lot of time during the journey.\n\nHowever, public transport has also advantages. On the one hand,public transport affords you to waste money, because the price of the ticket is not very expensive. On the other, travelling by metro or bus pollute less than going by car. The reason is that when you use the car,you normally go on your own and when you travel by metro or car lot of people are travelling at the same time as you.\n\nIn my opinion, there are more people who travel by car every day, even for short journeys. For me, people have become very lazy and they prefer the car rather than puiblic transport, because you can take the car when you want and go where you want whotout spending hours waiting for the bus. The consequence of this is that in the near future the public transport will disappear. \n","word_count":261}

There is not exactly a good day for running, for even the rainy days are excellent for a good run. If one has a sunny and windy weather, it is nice because the sun warms one up and the wind helps keep it fresh.

The first times may be hard, in that they require a preparation a sedentary person does not have. There can be some pain and almost everybody becomes really exhausted at the beginning. After the first trials, however, improvements are shortly noticed and the results come quickly: better breathing, uninterrupted and quiet sleep, and an unmistakable sense of well-being. It even helps reducing your belly!\nDespite being a common and easy to do activity, running needs some care to prevent injuries and other disturbances as well. Efficient sweat expeller socks help one reduce the uncomfortability and keep one's feet in a nice temperature. Notwithstanding, a formidable pair of shoes makes a huge difference if one plans to keep practising the sport for a long period. Go to a doctor, ask him to analyse the type of step to make up with an ideal footwear. This way, there will be less trouble when practising the exercise.\nI must say that, as a runner, I do not regret it at any time. Everybody can do, it is practical and simple, and the goals can be set in accord with the person's needs and restrictions. Do not hesitate to go out and try it out!

These causes also had a negative impact on two regions that were analysed, in Europe and Oceania, and, consequently, these areas had higher rates in terms of total land degreaded.\n\nA closer look at the pie chart reveals that over-grazing was the most important reason why land was so degraded, with the highest percentage of 35%. This was followed by the deforestation, with 30%, while over-cultivation had 28%. Finally, 7% could be explained for other reasons. It may be justified by the fact that there was an excess of chemicals in the agricultural activity. This also needs to be compared to the table. Not surprisingly, these causes played an important role when we talk about the percentage of land which was affected by these causes, particularly in Europe and Oceania. In the first case, Europe reprented the highest percentage of land degraded caused by deforestation and over-cultivation, 9.8% and 7.7% respectively. This was a great impact on total land degraded as Europe was more affected, with a total of 23%. By another side, Oceania had the highest land degraded rate at 11.3% bacause of over-grazing, which also contributed to having 13% of land degraded.

In Nepal students study individually, do not ask questions with the tutor even if they are confused.  Meanwhile, Australian education is based on making students learn new skills.  Students need to have an active participation in discussion with their peers.  Besides, students are able to raise questions with the lecturer because they can express their opinion.  At first I felt difficult, stressed while studying in groups used to hesitate while sharing my ideas, opinion but now I am familiar with the academic culture.\nAcademic culture is challenge for many students for effective learning.  Peer learning is a small group of three to five students who are kept together to discuss the content and carry out educational activities in mutual engagement.  (Fisher, as cited in Strake, 2010, p.2), Peer learning is a two way learning process in which members of group feel easier to discuss the content.  It helps to know the importance of group work by giving and receiving feedback on particular tasks.   According to Hamp (2002), the goal of EAP (English For Academic Purpose) course is to teach students relevant study skills they need throughout their degree.  It helps to share the ideas, knowledge, among the students and make them think critically, by using formal language while writing and so on. \nIn conclusion, the adoption of Australian academic culture has developed strategies for my learning.

On the other hand, despite the numerous documentaries, news and cultural programs which are passed on every day, another fact that must be considered is the incredible amount of the so-called rubbish TV, which has been impacting badly on the younger generation, and the extreme violence of some movies transmitted even during times that should be considered as a protected band for children.  Furthermore I should probably mention the enormous amount of advertisements that every single day people are forced to watch once they have switched on this box. In my opinion, the real problem of this potentially useful tool is due to the fact that television is essentially a passive means of communication.

Whether at some point you are fed up with art and culture, the city offers to you a lot of leisure time facilities such as concerts, exhibitions, festivals and so on!

By the way, a friend of mine runs an hotel in a seaside resort and I know that he was looking forward to an English native speaker who could help him with his foreign guests.

It is importatnt when we work or study in international area.\n\nIt can have benefits but also some drawbacks. Firstly I would like to write about benefits. People who are learning another language or more languages have more opportunities in their life. It can have influence at their work. They can have better position, work for foreign company, communicate with foreign companies etc. It can be the benefit at school as well, because if you need some information for some project, you can look at foreign literature too. Also you can be part of travelling and working experience which can offer to you your school. If you want to try this option, you need to have a very good level of particular language. It is very good that these days schools offer you more languages for learning to choose from and they recommend learning at least 2 foreign languages. Of course it can be different in each country. Another very important benefit of learning new language is that you can travel you will understand people abroad and you will know how to communicate with them. It helps you to ask people on many important information which you need during your journey. For example, which way you should go, where is good restaurant, how to travel in a country, how to solve your problems, where is the cheapest accommodation and much more. Thanks of learning another language you can have also friends from  all the world and you can better understand the culture of new country.\n\nAnd what are the drawbacks?\nI think that there is not many disandvantages of learning another language. One of them can be that people who do not understand this language will try to ask you all the time to help them. It can be really interrupting if it still continues. And sometimes maybe you do not want to hear what are people speaking about in foreign language.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to say that the learning of another language will be always important for today\u00b4s people and new generation too and in addition it will increase need to communicate in another language.\n\n","word_count":375}

Nowadays, it might be argued if the current transportation system would be working in the future like present, while there is a still big room for public transportation remaining as a significant method. This essay will offer a couple of points about whether public transportation will still be around us or if it will disappear completely.\n\nFor a start, the convenience for us to travel around would probably be one of the main arguments. In some countries, the amount of transportation such as train is not sufficient, which forces people to use private cars. However, it is also true that there are always minors who have no choice but to take public transport and also for their parents it is definitely more reliable. \n\nWhat is also important is the impact on the environment, which is already considerably damaged by human technology. If a car which emits no serious global warming gas would be developed, there would be no argument that people had better reduce our use of cars, yet, as long as we are manufacturing them we could not find more eco-friendly and efficient ways than public transportation.\n\nIn conclusion, it is my belief that it is not possible for public transport to disappear in the future even though travelling with cars is more convenient than travelling with just trains or buses. But in the same way as cars development, our governments might have to make some progress on public transport to encourage citizens to be more eco-friendly.\n","word_count":270}

Personally, I disagree with that the money is the most important consideration for deciding a job, because there are several factors equally important.\n\nI believe that other considerations are as important as money. Firstly, the core values and the reputation of the company are necessarily concerned. Working in a company which is built up with good core values and has an excellent reputation could easily obtain the fulfillment and keep passion in job for a long time. We would believe that this job is worth contributing to for life. Secondly, the co-worker relationship and the atmosphere in the workplace are extremely important when choosing a job. Having a kind boss or friendly colleagues, for example, can bring workers the senses of belonging and enjoyment from working, hence the working quality may arise greatly.\n\nAdmittedly, money is necessary for people's daily lives, satisfying their basic demand. For example, the expenditure of food, drinks and commodities need the support from the steady income. Furthermore, we may need much more money to have some activities, such as worldwide travel or outdoor camping for days. In addition, in the life-long consideration, health-care would be increasingly important with people getting older, hence enough amount of money as a stable income could not be disregard.\n\nIn conclusion, while salary still plays a role and certainly affects people's choice of profession, I believe that money does not outweigh all the other factors.\n","word_count":252}

{"index":182300,"grade":"B","full_text":"When facing a decision on whether to shop in a shopping center or in small stores, many people will choose the shopping center because you can buy all types of products at once. Others, including myself, believe that shop in small stores is the premium choice. In the following essay, I will outline two reasons to support my view.\nFirst, small stores provide products with more unique feature and different selection. That is to say, most small stores may have their own logos on mugs or even T-shirts and it is more likely to find handmade products in it. For instance, my friends once bought a nice scruff with cute animal figure in a small store and I really like it after she showed me. Therefore, the next day she brought me back to the store, we found out that they did not have the same scruff because it is the only one. Although I was disappointed that I could not have the same scruff but this is the fun part that shop in small stores, you can always find something unique.\nSecond, it is true that shop in a shopping center is fast and convenient because one can buy all types of things together. However, most shopping center provide limited selections and sometimes the price is expensive.\nIn conclusion, I prefer to shop in a small stores because it is more likely to find the one and the only product while it also provides a sense of treasure hunting.\n","word_count":250}

Even though being truthful is crucial in relationship, always telling the truth would be considered as hurting others' feelings and is unwise. Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the employer. It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment.\nTo further illustrate the first point above, could hurt one's feelings by telling the truth at all time. For example, if some woman you are acquainted wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the occasion. People usually tend not telling her the truth since it could make her feelings. Instead of doing so, people may praise her with other things on her. In that case, they could still make conversions without boiling her mood.\nThe other point is when it comes to personal matters, people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just got acquainted. If there are questions about things one do not want other people to know, they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much.

Within the town centre itself there is a wide selection of stores offering local crafts, fashion clothing, food or wine.

In Budapest the rubbish is collected separetely. In the new buildings there are usually dustbins for each material (glass, plastic, etc.), and around the older buildings there are more and more separate dustbins. So, almost everybody, who lives in Budapest, has the chance to use this form of rubbish collection.\nIt would be logical that we recycle the garbage as much as possible, and there are factories, where they use this technique, but in Budapest we usually don't use much recycled goods recently. And it is a serious problem, because in the not so distant future we won't be able the handle the garbage-it won't be enough space where we could deposit that.\nAn another (one could say the most) important question about a capital city is: how clean is it? In that area Budapest accomplishes very awful. In spite of the number of the cleaners, the town is dirtier than Vienna or Prague. Naturally it's mainly depends on us: if we could put our garbage into the dustbin, instead of letting it on the streets, it would be easier to keep it clean. However, it wouldn't be impossible to collect the rubbish and clean the streets more often-it's just a matter of organisation.\n","word_count":241}

However,the situation has already changed.\n\nFirst,as the technology developed,we may find visiting museum is far from convenient.People using new technique has gradually constitued the majority.The online visiting is a good point in this case.The Forbidden City,one of the most famous museum in China,has opened its online version to the public,which means people can visit the Forbidden City on the Internet instead of taking a time-consuming flght to Beijing where the museum locates.It leads to an increasing number of people choose to using the online museum.\n\nOn the other hand,needless to say,the limitation of museum is that it can only store some pictures and paintings,it is far from an enjoyable visiting when you can only see the picture 2 meters away and no touch. The scenery, the beauty of mountain and river,can only be enjoyed when you travel there on youe own.Once I visited the museumm finding some pictures of the cave painting in France,but when I got France to see the real painting,I found it is more vivid and can show you how great the France caveman who painted it.\n\nAdmittedly,the museum has its owm merits;it is easy to find on the map and always be emphazised as a symbol of a country. However,more often than not,the high price of the ticket of the museum can ruin the fun when you get to the coutry.A documentary,a book about the culture is cheap and easy.we can consider it a ecomomical method.\n\nVisiting museum is undoubtedly a good way to konw about a country,but not a best way anymore. If you decide to find some information about a totally unknowed land,the museum is not a wise option.\n \n\n","word_count":308}

Potential issues such as rule violation and conflicts may be arose because the foreigners may not understand the rules. \nJapanese, as pointed out by Trompenaars (cited in Morrison , 2006), is highly influenced by the values of universalism. Similarly, the high level of uncertainly avoidance and the low level of indulgence (Hofstede 1994) cause the Japanese society seems to be obedient and self-disciplined. The main reason for Japanese that they always follow the rules is to respect and hope not to cause any confusion to other users. Also, Japanese think highly of the enjoyment of bathing in a clean environment. As a result in Australia, conflicts may be caused due to the high level of indulgence and individualism in Australian culture (Hofstede 1994), people may usually emphasize in their self-satisfaction and think of themselves first instead of the public. They may not consider the public interest and not give precedence to other users. Consequently, the bathing pool may face the hygienic problems, such as someone does not wash before bathing , and scrambling issues.\n\nIn order to achieve cost efficiency, the choice of locations and decor must be thoroughly considered. A location whether it has sufficient quantity of water or not is the essential consideration. Rental cost is also a limitation as it is relatively higher in Australia. \n","word_count":238}

In magazine, they are telling us we can see a lot of games no matter where we are. Developed technology, we can see the game which happened in the opposite of the earth. Time and place aren't matter for people to watch the game. Everybody has a favorite sport. Soccer is the one of the famous sport for many people. World cup has been the world famous festival. People can enjoy just seeing the soccer game and they are eager to root for their favorite team. Why the soccer has been one of the best sport in the world? Here are 2 reasons.\n\nFirst of all, soccer is more active than other sports. Activation makes people exciting and remember their memory. This activation make us also enjoy seeing and play the game. For example, American football always has a moment to set the position. To me, it is boring point when I see the American football. I can give you another example. Watching the baseball game also bores me. Sometimes, game just finished with pitcher and catcher's catch ball game. Other athletes just stand there and watch the game just like us. However, in soccer, every single player touch the ball, even the goalkeeper has a chance to get the ball. On this point, there is second reason I can say.\n\nSecond reason is that soccer involved for all players to participate into the game. For baseball, if hitter couldn't hit the ball, other players would not need to move at all. To me, that is weird. Players are on the same ground and some of people are playing the game and some are not. Playing almost 3 hours, some players couldn't touch the ball. Can we say these players participating in the game? I would not rather say yes.\n\nIf somebody wanted to play a soccer, I would recommend that he or she has to have a stretching because soccer is very active sport so always has a possibility to be injured. Also, I will say you should wear the soccer shoes and socks. Those items will help you not to be injured. Drinking enough water would be good habit to enjoy not only soccer but also any other sport.\n\nNowadays, many people have their own favorite sports but people are starting to ignore other sports except their favorite sport. We need to respect other sports and other people's perspectives. Soccer could be one of the boring sport to other people.     \n","word_count":430}

However, as a resident of the country, we can not forget about the history and about our ancestors services rendered to the nation as well as our culture and ideology. As a reward for their efforts. \n Each nation has their own historical places, Vietnam is not an outcast, we also have many historical places which help the younger generations to understand throughout about the past. Those places will help them to take a close look about the root of our nation and learn how to appreciate our culture, custom and tradition. We can mention many places such as Sword Lake, H\u1ecfa L\u00f2 prison, Temple of Literature...\n  Today, I will mention about one of the iconic places of Vietnam which you can not miss when travel to Vietnam. It is Temple of Literature, the first university of the nation. Temple of Literature was built in 1070 under the Ly's dynasty. In spite of wars and the destruction of time, Temple of Literature is still preserved in good shape until now. We can still see many ancient structures which show the main trend of architecture at that time. As many other Asian country, in the past, we were greatly influenced by the ideology system of Confucius, a philosopher from China. He built up a system which based on 4 essential relationships in the society. The lessons that scholars at that time were received, most of them were about his ideology. Otherwise, they learned mostly about literature, poetry. \n We can briefly describe the overall structure of Temper of Literature which consists of six parts. Firstly, there were 3 main gates, the center one only for the king, the left side one was for administrators, the right site one was for military. Scholars only could enter by a small gate from aside. Then there are five courtyards from the first one to the fifth one from outside to inside. One remarkable, featured point about Temple of Literature is the people who passed 4 rounds of examination, then gained position titles would be graved their names on the stone grave carried on stone turtles. Right at the moment entering, you can see them from two sides of the courtyards. Temple of Literature is a hollow place for students even now. Before the university entrance examinations, many students come here and wish for their luck. \n Temple or Literature ( or Imperial Academy) can be seen as the most featured historical place in Vietnam.

As the other sports, tennis is getting more modern, fast and commercial. I mean professional tennis. Some  children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory. Some of them practise tennis because of their parents. It is not fair enough. Children should play games, not just tennis, because it is fun, it develops their skills, helps to physical health and so on. You can start if you are grown up anyway. It is never too late. Either you can find a professional coach or just join your friends. Enjoy! \n","word_count":173}

Another thing is that: I would improve my skills in working with children and I find the money useful to expand my academic qualifications. \n    Firstly, I am a young college student, a friendly person and devoted to my studies. I enjoy cooking as one of my hobbies. I also take pleasure in playing tennis, for the benefits of practising sports and staying active. Besides, I particularly enjoy outdoor activities rather than indoor ones. \n   I believe this job would suit me for the following reasons: I am familiarized with the environment in summer camps as I spent my previous summer in one. Another reason is that I have gained experience taking care of children from working as a babysitter recently.

However, public transport has been critised more and more over the last years because of its inconenvience. Some people go even so far and don\u00b4t assume that public transport will have a future at all.\n\n\nA lot of public services were cut down in order to save money. Therefore, busses are not running as often or reglulary as they used to. Especially in the countryside, public transport is no alternative to cars due to the lack of frequency. Consequently, people prefer taking the car. Firstly, because they gain independence therewith. Secondly, they can visit each place without any circumstances. For instance,there is no need to change the bus. It is also more convenient to go to work by car as you can leave when it suits you and not because the last bus is running. In addition, the car is also more convenient in respect of the timing. After having had a long day at work, people long to get home as quick as possible.\n\nFurthermore, ticket prices have been increased rapidly in the last years. Travelling by train as a family or group is often far more expensive than taking the car. \n\nNevertheless, public transport still provides several advantages in comparison to taking the car. For example, it is no parking space required. Sitting in the bus can also be quite relaxing, especially considering the heavy traffic during rush hours. Finally, it still provides a useful way of travel for all who don\u00b4t have a driving licence.\n\nIn the end, the service of public transport needs to change to attract more people and to have a rosieer future.

{"index":104735,"grade":"B","full_text":"It\u2019s really important that we do things we should do. So, we can obtain certain benefits and more doors that can be opened easily. There are some people that spend too much of their time doing nothing useful although others may say that it helps to be more relaxed in their lives. Personally, people must dedicate most part of their time on things they should do for two important reasons.\n \nFirst, you gain time doing essential things. By doing so, you immediately take advantage of the time in your life doing something essential. For example, when I was 17, I was about starting my first day of class in the university. I started to feel  bored with complementary courses on my curriculum because there were the kind of courses that didn\u2019t have any help to my university career which is mainly about System Engineering, and I was required to take complementary courses such as Ecology, Laws, and so on. But later when I graduated, I realized how important were those subjects. I was able to explain something basic about Ecology that my grandfather had trouble with in the countryside when I went for a vacation. That experience taught me how important it is doing whatever you are required to do\u2014such as taking complementary courses\u2014without rejecting it, because somehow it\u2019ll be helpful later in the life.\n \nSecond, if you avoid doing things only because those don\u2019t like you, you\u2019ll miss opportunities. You\u2019ll dedicate your time only on things for personal enjoyment and it really will hurt you. For instance, a friend of mine called Freddy was in a social club in the city, he was requested to do a running around the pool for 30 minutes. He refused to do this. After all, one guy decided to do the venture. He ran for 30 minutes around the pool and when he finished, my friend started laughing at him. Nobody had noticed that the president of the social club has an award for the runner, and he received an amount of 30,000 dollars because of his effort. As you can see, my friend lost the opportunity because he didn\u2019t like what he was requested to do.\n \nTo sum up, it is a good decision if you do things that are necessary or needed at the moment though you don\u2019t like it. If you do essential things you gain time in your life at the same time. If you would rather avoid essential or required things you\u2019ll lose many chances to succeed. So, we should focus our minds making the right decision and spend our time wisely doing what is most important. \n","word_count":439}

On the other hand, the skyscraper makes more problems, such as pollution. For example, I designed the highly architecture in the highly population density city in Taiwan. The skyscraper provides more space for excess population; however, the building will produces more pollution when the skyscraper constructs by modern materials, such as steel and concrete. They will destroy the environment when the raw material digs out from the site. The pollution must hurt the local people and environment from the site of raw materials.

On the one hand everything is very cleaned including floor, bath and corridors, in addition, if you are a disabled person you will not have any trouble to get there because there are  some ramps to help you come in.

To be honest, I am not sure.\nAlthough privately oned cars are more and more popular, and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries, it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future.\nMost people today realize that in our cities and in our planet there ia an increasing problem of space and pollution.

I would say that most probably private care are not 'sustainables' in the long term, and it will be necessary to revert to some sort of public transport. \nThe population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow of a staggering 3 billions human beings. I know that it is nice to dream a future of technological people flying around, each of them with its own private small helicopter. But it is not going to happen. I guess that in our future there are no helicopters, and not even cars. \nStates and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative.

As a result, if you use public transport, you have to pay an expensive subscription and different tickets. There is no future for public transport because buses and trains are broken and dirty and people prefer to avoid them. So people prefer travelling with their own means of transport instead of paying to travel in a terrible way. On the other hand, if we don't use public transport and every person use a car, pollution will increase a lot.

As I have an interest in thrillers, I decided to give it a try. The poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and mystery which made me take the decision to watch this film.\n\nThe film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character, which is a 16-year-old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what it seems to be a camp. He has no idea how he ended up there.However, he soon realizes that this is not a normal camp, which is located next to a giant and mysterious maze. The people who lives in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves from the menaces of the maze. He took the role of a runner, the people responsible for exploring the maze and look for an exit of this place. Still, they only have the daylight time to explore the maze, as when the sun goes down it becomes very dangerous.\n\nThe film keeps getting better and better as you watch it, having its exciting moments when the characters discover something that hidden inside the maze. I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent.\n","word_count":239}

The exam is organized by Cambridge ESOL and it takes place twice a year. Because I had decided to take my exam in June, it was absolutely necessary to join an English preparation course as soon as possible. If I would like to pass the exam, I had to improve my English skills. So, I had started to learn English very frequently and pretty hard. \n\nI had been learning English for the last six months. I had studied English at least two hours a day and longer. Very soon I had recognized that the process of learning was not easy as I fought. I had a lot of things to improve, such as writing and reading skills. Moreover, I had many problems with the English grammar. It was pretty sure that a lot of work had been waiting for me ahead.\n\nBut I am really lucky person. I had found a good teacher who supported me all the time. I also had some colleagues who had the same aims as mine. We had been meeting for learning frequently.

Because we didn't live in any English native country, we had tried as much as possible to create an English speaking environment. \n\nToday it is a big day for me and my colleagues.

{"index":355122,"grade":"B","full_text":"We must reduce exam stress from high school students. Exam stress leads to many bad consequences towards High School Students. These consequences vary, one example would be that students may get lower grades on their exams, or even fail them. They can also have constant mood changes and high levels of nervousness, since they may have lost many hours of sleep whilst studying for a certain exam. As a result, many High School Students may not concentrate during classes, or whilst studying since they have many things on going through their heads (since they've been studying a lot). Based on all the problems listed (and many more), we must find solutions that will help both students and professors to deal with exam stress.\nOne of the solutions I would give is to hand in study guides to the students. This will help them as a method to study or review for the exam and reduce their levels of stress. The study guide doesn't need to necessarily be a long and complex one (since those may cause them stress too); they may be just a quick review with a couple of concepts and exercises. Another simple solution I think could help is to study as well as to review content during sessions before a certain exam, to help the students study whilst still having a class. The previous are the best possible solutions I would address in order to stop once and for all the problem of stress thanks to exams, in which most of the cases, as the previous paragraph explained, leads to many more.\n\n","word_count":265}

{"index":163287,"grade":"B","full_text":"     Learning many ideas and knowing detailed facts both are considered  crucial  for  students education.  Some people think that knowing fact  is more easily and practicable. Nevertheless, others consider learning  ideas and concept is the best way to  confront many academic and real-life problems. In my view, l   completely  agree with the idea that it is important to  students to learn idea and concept than learn facts. I would like to explain my reasons.\n \n        First, learning facts  can help students to solve one kind of problems that they may face. However, ideas and concepts give people competitive edge in dealing with other similar issues. For example, once I do n\u2019t grasp an idea that my teacher have explained  in class, but just remember facts.   When I do my homework, I find  the problem is different than the case   discussed in the class. While, I go back to my textbook and  try to realize ideas and concepts. I work out the problem easily. From this experience, I learn that I do not just remember  facts, but try my best to understand ideas and concept. thus, I can  solve many kinds of problem  simply.\n\n   Second,  learning ideas and concepts support self-education greatly. Consequently, you can reach high academic levels. It is easy to know facts from people around you. However, learning ideas and concepts need more investigation and understanding many of the academic textbooks.  .  Nowadays, there are limited time for any teacher to cover all point in  a certain subject. When, students  catch  the idea of any topic it will be easy to understand all issue related to it deeply. For instance,  when I  was in senior year in high school. I took physics class. It was massive materials on a specific issue, but I attempted my best to catch its notion that made me recognize any unmentioned points.\n\nIn sum,  absorbing ideas and facts is the most effective strategy. Not only do   student learn more in  their studying, but also they help students  understanding many facts in our life better than any other ways.       \n\n","word_count":343}

Because I don\u2019t know what kinds of ingredients the restaurant put. Also the food I make by myself is much healthier. Because all of the restaurants want to earn money, so they will just use cheap and not healthy ingredients to cook the food. But if I make my own food, of course I won\u2019t use any kind of unhealthy ingredients. So the food I made by my own hands is safer than any other food that is made in restaurants. And also homemade food has better quality than low price restaurants. \nSecondly, it\u2019s much cheaper to eat at home, because restaurants want to earn money. So you can save lots of money if you cook at home. Some people think cooking themselves is too annoying or tired so they go out to eat. But actually if you cook much you can use your energy so you can consume your weight. Also if you cook three times a day your cooking ability will go up. \nThirdly, eating at home is more comfortable.

But if you eat at home you don\u2019t need to be caring that somebody will look at you open your mouth too big or talk too loud. Also the restaurant don\u2019t know how much you can eat, so sometimes they give you too less food you don\u2019t get full. Or sometimes they give you too much food so you have to throw it away. And as you know, throwing food away is a bad habit to do which makes our planet, Earth will be polluted\nFourthly, you won\u2019t have to waste your time going out to find a restaurant and come back home. And sometimes if there are many customers you have to wait for the chef to cook other\u2019s food first. You can save time if you eat at home. \nFifthly, we can have a family time while eating.

The car is a quick, cheap and easy transport since you can use it when you want and you can park it where you want. When you use the car, you do not have to think in timetables and you don\u00b4t have to pay expensive tickets for travelling. However, I think that this transport has some disadvantages, for instance: if in a small city there are a lot of cars, the pollution will increase and the environment will be injured. Also, when a city is small the people should walk to different places since everything is near to your houses.\nRelated to the use of the car, I would like to say that the Extremadura\u00b4s roads need a big reparation because, for example, the road between C\u00e1ceres and Badajoz is very damaged and it is difficult to drive for it. \n\nIn Extremadura, the second transport most used is the bus. On the one hand, there are buses that connect the several neighbourhoods of the cities with the centre of them. On the other hand, there are buses for travelling large distances. I think that the urban buses have improved in C\u00e1ceres. The last year, the mayor changed the old buses by new buses without increase the prices. Now, it is securier to travel than last years.

For example, Kyoto is a popular place to visit because it has a lot of invaluable temples.  Sapporo is an attractive place because raw fish and vegetables are fresh and nice to eat.  Among these places, Mt.Fuji is the most wonderful place in Japan because its scenery is so beautiful, it is a popular place and it offers several exciting activities.\n\nThe first reason is Mt.Fuji has very beautiful scenery.  For instance, in winter, Mt.Fuji changes to a white face by snow.  The white Mt.Fuji is very beautiful, so it has been the subject of countless works of art such as the 'Thirty-six Views of Mt. Fuji', a series of \u201cukiyo-e\u201d paintings by Hokusai.  Also, in summer, almost all the snow on Mt Fuji melts and it changes to brown and green colors.  At a summer sunset, Mt.Fuji is so majestic that many pictures and paintings have been done of Mt.Fuji at sunset.      Depending on the season, Mt.Fuji makes various beautiful sights and it always fascinates many people.\n\nThe second reason is that Mt.Fuji is a popular mountain.  People who come here are so many.  A lot of travelers and climbers come to climb the mountain and more than 200,000 people climb to the top of Mt.Fuji in a year.  In addition, many cameramen and painters come to record the beautiful landscape of Mt.Fuji.  Also, many observers of weather, stars or space come here, since this is an important place to observe weather, stars and space.\n\nThe last reason is that Mt.Fuji offers several exciting leisure activities.  Climbing to the top of Mt.Fuji is allowed in late July and August.  To climb to the mountaintop is not easy because the height is more than 3,700 meters.  However, numerous climbers come to experience seeing the very beautiful view such as the exquisite rising sun from Mt.Fuji.  Besides, a marathon takes place ever year.  This marathon is very hard due to severe conditions of low oxygen and a steep slope, so people who are proud of strong body try this marathon.  Furthermore, around Mt.Fuji, there are five beautiful lakes and many hot springs.  These offer a camping, fishing, cruising, and taking a hot spring bathing with a nice view. \n\nEnjoying an activity with a nice view is relaxing to people.  Japan has a lot of good places for relaxing, but the best place is Mt.Fuji.  Mt.Fuji has beautiful scenery, it is popular and it offers exciting activities for people.  Mt.Fuji will continue to give wonderful impression to many people forever.\n\n","word_count":429}

In my opinion any transport is completely safe, however people say the plane is the safest transport.\nAnd, maybe the car is the most comfortable. It is true that both are advantages and disadvantages.\n\nTravelling by car can be enjoyable, dangerous and relaxing, I knew this is a contradiction, but I can explain it. Relaxing because you can travel by yourself, with friends and with your family. When you make a long trip you can go without pressure. If you are tired you can stop at a petrol station or at a restaurant to relax yourself, and if in the car there are more passengers you can change with them, so you will feel less tired.\n\nEven travel by car, in my opinion, has a lot of problems. Some advantages could be:\n\n-\tGasoline is too expensive\n-\t There aren\u2019t enough car parks and they are very expensive, for example when you travel to Madrid it is impossible to find a free parking. \n-\tOften you can be involved in city traffic jams, especially in the rush hour. This situation only is present in Caceres when there is a rainy day, but in other cities like Madrid, Barcelona\u2026 is a daily situation.\n\nI think, driving can be dangerous because people must respect speed limits, and not every time that it is. People doesn\u00b4t wear the seatbelt, use phones, and even there are who drink when they are going to drive. All these malpractice can make they have an accident and other innocent persons are in danger.\n\nEvery holiday, the DGT, in Spain, make an awareness campaign to remember us the good manners when we are driving. \n\nOn the other hand, travelling by plane people say is safer then do it in others transport.  I don\u00b4t make sure this affirmation. I\u00b4m afraid to travel by plane. I hate the moment when the plane is taking off, and when it is touching off. I\u00b4m afraid so that started when I was travelling to Mexico in my honeymoon. In this moment there was a tropical storm, and the turbulences are horrible; but a not time I have stopped to travel by plane. I knew is the better option when you want to travel abroad. \n\nIt is true, that plane is very expensive, at least I never haven\u00b4t be able to book a cheap ticket. I look for the perfect offer but in summer it is impossible to find it.\n\nTo sun up, all kind of transport have positive and negative aspects, but depending of our necessity we use one or another. For example there are a lot of countries where bike is the most main of transport, like Belgium. I remember there were kilometres and kilometres of cycle line, on the contrary than here in Spain, where few cities like Madrid or Barcelona, strengthen their use.\n\n","word_count":484}

There are certain people who believe community service orders are more adequate in some cases. People who break the law, should be ordered to work in community in order to pay for their misdeeds, when they have done a minor offence or if they have acted unintentionally.\nCommunity service orders are more appropriate than prison punishments when people have acted unintentionally. Sending criminals to prison is a serious verdict for people that have made a mistake. Nobody is sinless and people should not be treated as serious as being sent to jail. For example, graffiti makers in Bulgaria are sent to prison for 4 years. This is unfair, because they do not do any harm to the environment nor to the society. It is better that they do a certain amount of community work, for example clean their graffiti, which will teach them how hard it is to clean graffiti, and thus, prevent them from making new ones.\nWorking in the community is more adequate compared to sending people to prison when criminals have done a minor offence. Limiting people\u2019s freedom because of minor, non-harmful to the society crimes is inhumane. Everybody deserves freedom, despite its crimes. Although their misdeeds should not be tolerated, I believe that had better do some community work. This will help them understand their mistakes and prevent them in future.

In the century of advancing communications and technology it is hard to imagine the world without medicine, astronomy, computers, and history.

The plot revolves around Vianne Rocher, a single mother and chocolate expert, opening a \u2018chocolaterie\u2019 right before Lent in a small, close-minded French village, the mayor of which decides to boycott her. During Lent, the protagonist gets to know other outcasts (mainly women) and help them. However, Vianne must learn to solve her own problems and change the course of her own life.\n\nOne of the strengths of the film is its star-studded cast: Juliette Binoche as Vianne, Alfred Molina as the mayor, Judi Dench as a grumpy, elder woman resented with the oppressing society of the village, and a young Johnny Depp as a handsome gypsy arriving in town with his caravan. Each and every one of the roles is beautifully written and the actors don\u2019t fail in bringing them to life. Besides the cast, I would like to highlight the original soundtrack. It adapts perfectly to the theme of the movie, with a little bit of jazz manouche, a popular genre amongst European gypsy communities, and reminiscences of Mexican folklore, as the recipes Vianne Rocher prepares in the \u2018chocolaterie\u2019 are a heritage from her Maya ancestors.\n\nIf I had to find a down side to Chocolat, it would be that the film format does not allow us to have a deeper look into some of the characters and their storylines.

Is there something that makes us unique? Is it the genes we are born with? Or are we a product of our own lives? \nIt is clear that genes play a very important part in the person we are. Family characteristics such as eye and hair colour are inherited by children from their parents as well as some diseases and mental disorders. Therefore, what we need to consider is whether our personality and personal skills are born or made. \nThose who hold that nature has a stronger influence than nurture on developing our personal identity will claim that certain personality traits are also determined by our genes. Nevertheless, identical twins that were separated when they were very young and have been raised in different environments show differences in their personalities. This provides evidence that life experiences and surrounding where you grow up have defined the kind of person you are today.\nRegarding personal skills, there are a large number of cases in which children were born gifted for the same field as their parents having great potential for a specific art or science since early childhood. However, nature doesn\u00b4t always endow us with inborn abilities. For instance, parents tend to instil their own passions in their children and, consequently, they will likely be interested in the same academic or artistic field. According to this fact, parents often shape their children\u00b4s lives encouraging them to follow in their footsteps. Likewise, some people put their success in life down more to their parent\u00b4s training than to their innate talents. \nSo, to conclude we would have to argue that both nature and nurture make us who we are. As I see it, personal identity is the result of the interaction of our genetic structure and the environment which surrounds us. The problem is how to separate these two influences and how to find out which the strongest is in each case. \n\n","word_count":342}
{"index":212211,"grade":"C","full_text":"Due to the ever-increasing population coupled with the climate change, food shortage has become a significant facing by many countries. Some assert that genetically modified technology can be applied to address this problem. This essay will argue that genetically modified food can be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increasing food yield.\n\nFirstly, GM food can have a positive impact on the problem of food safety. It is well known that the GM food is inserted with various resistance genes, such as pest disease resistance gene. This means that the food being more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases can minimise the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment. This reduction in the application of chemical materials can create a safer agricultural environment, ensuring food safety.\n\nFurthermore, GM food can also improve the production of crops. Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology, such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance, GM food can ensure the food production in the period of drought. This could be important for food production, especially in developing countries. However, some may argue that it is also questionable whether GM food has a detrimental impact on human health. Actually, thousands of tests on GM food, before bring it into markets, have been proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that GM food can increase food yields with the less use of chemicals. In views of this, it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortage. However, because there are some disadvantages in GM technology which is being developed, it is also recommended that governments should give more importance to the management of GM food.\n","word_count":317}

Many people would disagree, but our future depends on public transport.\nFirst of all, our environment is polluted and if we are determined to save it we should definitely stop using cars. Since cars produce exhaust fumes which slowly destroy our planet, we should start using public transport more often. Although there are many other polluters, such as big industries, people should start with the easiest resolutions.\nAlthough many countries do not offer a good public transport service, once people get rid of cars there will be more money for the improvements. For instance, Copenhagen and Vienna are good examples for this.  It seems like cars are losing the battle in this case because these cities propagate the idea that riding bicycles can lead to better future. As more money is being invested in the infrastructure, people tend to use more bikes and public transport.\nUnfortunately, not many people are prepared to renounce all the advantages car provides. For example, it is claimed that it is more convenient to travel by car than bus because you can make breaks whenever you want to and they are more spacious. Moreover, it is faster to travel by car than by any other public transport - planes are an exception to this rule.\nIn conclusion, I think that public transport should win this battle. It is a fight for the better and healthier future. The aforementioned representative examples of Vienna and Copenhagen prove how easy it can be to remove cars from our lives, and I believe that more cities should follow their examples.\n","word_count":272}

It is known, that it is the job of paparazzi to follow famous people and look for sensation in their daily behaviour and celebs are aware of the fact, that they are recognised everywhere, but an interest in one's private life, when the person doesn't want to is basically a synonim for trespassing. I strongly agree with the statement, that famous people also should have their own private lives, which no one's following and that no one knows about it. It is very hard to lead a normal life, when you have to think all day long, about what you say, what you wear and first of all, what you do. Being a celebrity means working all the time,you have not a single moment to relax and forget about your work. On the other hand, it is obvious that people want to know everything they can about celebrities they like or admire and journalists give them the opportunity to find out some information about their lives, but they often cross the line and literally deprive these famous people of private life.

Aspects such as space, internet access and materials will be discussed in order to make suggestions to improve the service for students learning languages.\n\nFirst, an inspection to the school\u00b4s facilities was organised, in order to assess the  school premises. From the visit, it was concluded that even if the majority of students express satisfaction with the space, some of them wish  to have more classrooms that allow a more reasonable number of students per class.  Currently, each class is given to 50 students which limits their opportunities to experience one o one activities that enhance their learning process. It would be advisable to accommodate classes in the main building that offers enough space for smaller classes.  \n\nSecondly, It was surprising to evidence an absence of Internet access in the computer room. Even if the room counts with a considerable number of computers, the absence of Internet does not give students the opportunity to use the many websites useful to improve their language skills. Therefore, I strongly recommend guaranteeing internet access which does not represent a high cost for the academic board. The access will give learners the possibility to use technological tools that will ensure a better experience while learning languages.\n\nFinally, authentic material in foreign languages was not found in the school\u00b4s library. It is crucial to provide students with printed material in the target language. Magazines and newspapers allow learners to have direct contact with language in real contexts. Thus, I suggest to make subscriptions to international magazines in order to enrich the school's library.\n\nConclusion.\n\nI strongly believe that if the suggestions made in this proposal are given attention, the service provided to language learners will be strengthen and enhanced. \n","word_count":309}

We could go shopping in the city centre, they have some very cool stores that we both will be able to enjoy even a Primark and I haven\u2019t seen some shops anywhere else yet. Furthermore there is a huge and cool movie theatre where we could watch a film together, since they\u2019ve got some very exciting films coming out. Or else there are some pubs we could visit, most of the time I quite enjoy going to a pub on the weekends myself, but it\u2019s all up to you. They even have a football stadium, so if you want to do that as well, let me know.\nIf you need a place to stay, I have a guestroom available, but that\u2019s entirely up to you.\nI hope I will hear from you soon!

We regulary organise film projections and discussions around a subject related to the film. We also invite guest speakers and organise fun events.\n\nBenefits for the students\n\nMany students gain a great deal from our activities. For example, with every film seen our students have the chance to practice their language and to develop their own opinions, particularly as we always have discussions aroud a subject related to the film. Also our monthly speakers are exellent, for example, last year we invited a well-known actrice, Janet Hewitt, to share some of her experience on Broadway. Unfortunalety, organising this kind of events is costly and the money from membership fees is not enough.\n\nBenefits for the college\n\nWe also believe the college benefits from our Club.

As well as that, the lifestyle of our society is pushing us to be more passive. And last but not least, it seems that new technologies are not helping to develop their social and intellectual skills.\n\nThe reasons could be, firstly, fast food is cheaper and very accessible for young people. In addition, spending too much time in activities like watching TV, surfing the Internet or playing video games prevent them from doing sports.  And finally, teenagers may become more dependent and introverted because of electronic devices such as mobile phones or personal computers.\n\nActually, it is not complicated to change habits in order to be healthier.

However , many countries have become more aware of the environmental issues each nation faces. In my opinion, we need a more convenient life but also to maintain a certain balance.\n\nFrist of all, the biggest problem is that the world's resources are extremely unequal. For example, Japan is the world's third largest economy after the United States and China, its economy is so developed, but food, oil, and other resources are all imported, and it put a lot of heavy industry into developing countries in order to protect its own environment. This has led to a growing gap between the rich and the poor, while the environment is also getting worse and worse. \n\nSecendly, with the increasing of the earth's population, the area of farmland is also decreasing. People in economically developed areas are in the pursuit of the perfect life and the people in the undeveloped areas are strving. So I think that the government must do something in this respect. \n\nThe government should find a balance point between economic development and agricultural development . I think that it would have to develop science and technology such as Yuan Longping's hybrid rice, or after the food can make people's great and then vigorously develop the economy. As part of the same planet, protecting the global environment is not only the task of the government but also the task of each of us.\n","word_count":272}

Unsure of what to does, she chase a rabbit in a blue waistcoat, and accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole From which she emerges in a forest, where she is greeted by many strange creatures. There Alice will star an adventure where she must slay the Red evil Queen and restore the White Queen to power.\nThe film features Mia Wasikowska as Alice. With her sweet face, pale skin, and great acting, she looks perfect as a confused and brave girl who has to save that \u201cwonderful\u201d world.  But we must not forget about the marvelous acting of Johnny Deep ( as the mad hatter) and Helena Bonham Carter( as the red queen), with them the film wouldn\u2019t be the same.\nBut it\u2019s not just the acting that is great in this film.

But there is one more question: travel by car or public transport? \nFirst of all, of course, travelling by car is much more convenient than, for example, by bus. You can drive wherever and whenever you want. Even just in cities, let it alone travelling at long distances. But, on the other hand, traffic jam or bad weather can make our trip inconvenient. Moreover, there are not many parking places in big cities.\nSecondly, travelling by public transport is much cheaper. Not all people can afford travelling by car every day so they choose public transport. \nThirdly, we should take care of our environment! Cars pollute our air what leads to many diseases such as asthma, allergy and even cancer. Moreover, cars release poisonous exhaust fumes and chemicals into the air, which mix with the water in the clouds, and the polluted rain, which later falls, damages trees, lakes and buildings.\nSo, my advice is to travel by bicycle (at least, use public transport) because it is environmentally friendly!\n","word_count":209}

A better future means having good food to eat without worrying, good clothes to wear, a big property, a private means of transportation and many more. Among them a private means of transportation suggests that there is no future for public transport. It is already in practice in western world. People from other parts of the world are also heading for the same dream. Having own car or means of transportation is the dream of every individual including me. A single car will not be enough for a family. Private care per individual is needed. It has also become a vital thing for life. Whether to go to work or other places travelling in private vehicle is hassle free. It saves lot of our time. We can indulge in many things if we can manage time properly. The trend of personal car is increasing rapidly. So, I believe that there is no future for public transport. We cannot deny that there will be time when no person would like to travel by bus or train. It is so much clear that private transport will overshadow the public vehicles.\n","word_count":205}

{"index":2785,"grade":"C","full_text":"Dear group leader,\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank you for the interest shown to our small village. I really hope that you have a nice welcome and, please, feel at home. Here, in Mallorca, there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend you a unique place, without tourists, noise and crowded beaches. \nOn the east of Mallorca you will find a small and beautiful village called Art\u00e0. In the municipality of Art\u00e0 you will find a coaster town, situated on the edge of the mountain range of Llevant. Sa Col\u00f2nia de Sant Pere is a traditional fishermen village. Nowadays, you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore. Here your adventure starts. In order to get to your destination you must ride a bicycle and just enjoy the splendid panoramic view. You will ride until Ca los cans, one of the most enigmatical beaches of Mallorca. This zone is part of a protected area, a natural park. For that reason, you must go riding a bike or walking. As Machado said \u201cse hace camino al andar\u201d. It means that the most important is the way, the journey. Going on a bike near the seashore with the breeze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life. On the way to Ca los cans, you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation. There are a lot of trees called \u201ctamarells\u201d, native trees of the coast of Mallorca. Moreover, you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restored. \nFinally, you will get to Ca los Cans. It is a special beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels. There you can practise different sports. It is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fishes, sea urchins and seaweed. There you can also take a canoe and paddle in the quite sea. \nA part from sports, you should note two different culture points. On the one hand, there is what remains standing of edificatications that were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen save from storms. On the other hand, there is a prehistorical tower called \u201cTalaiot\u201d. The function of the Talaiots is not clear yet. Maybe it was a defensive tower or an important building for high-class people.\nIt is important to stay in the beach until the sun goes down. The sunset in that place is ideal and romantic (especially if you are with your partner) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Tramuntana. From that seashore you can see all the Alc\u00fadia bay, part of the mountain range of Tramuntana and the cape of Formentor. \nCa los Cans is a mixture of sea, nature and culture. I am sure that you will like it and, of course, I need to ask you a favour: Please, keep the secret.\n\nRegards,\n\nPaula.\n\n","word_count":491}

It also cools you down from all the heat left from the summer and into the fall. You have fun with your family making snow angels and have snowball fights. \n             Spring is a good season because it is between winter and summer, temperatures are not too cold and not to hot.

Relaxing in the pool on a floating lounge chair enjoying cold lemonade is the ultimate experience.\n             Autumn is also a great season because of all the colorful leaves falling even though they are a hassle to pick up, especially in the pools. You can have fun walking with friends and admiring the different shades of colors on the leaves. The different colors warm your soul. \n             Autumn is such a calm season. The leaves turn beautiful tones of yellow, orange, and red. Everyone is starting over with a new class, a new teacher, and some new friends.

It takes a higher level of creativity and spontaneity to succeed in it than your usual basketball match, since its flexible rules, no-coach system, intensified relationship between the player and the crowd, and reduced number of participants widen and complexify its field of possible actions. The 'style' factor of it (or 'aesthetic value' if you will) also plays an important role, again, intensifying the relationship between team and the crowd while granting the pleasure of contemplating and executing flowing movement sequences, finishing a play, or just stylishly mocking your opponent. Not to mention the socially bonding ability of it, while on game tension between the opposing teams is somewhat inevitable, the irreverent, human, no strings attached nature of streetball events always compensate its negative aspects (which, upon closer inspection, reveal to be shared between every single sports event).

One of their jobs is to watch out their human family.  So if they sense that their owner might be in danger, they immediately  react by barking at a person or a thing thing that might have caused it. The stronger the bond between the dog and their owner, the stronger the dog's reaction will be.\nIt is believed that dogs require a lot of  attention, which is not true. Dogs are really not that hard to take care of, bathing and grooming don\u2019t need to be done every day, they just need to be fed and walked regularly.  These pets need a few walks a day, which could also be good for their owners who are spending all day at work or in school and need some physical activity. So having a dog could also remind them  to live a  healthier life.\nIn conclusion, dogs make really great pets. Not only do they protect you from anything that could do you any harm, but their amazing personality and the love they show to you  makes you feel so warm and wonderful on the inside. So if someone really loves their pet, they would find time to pay lot of attention to them, because, they truly are man's best friend.\n","word_count":353}

This form of transport can be used to avoid delays due to traffic conditions and parking restrictions. It can provide an opportunity for people to complete work during the journey. Public transport may be the only option for individuals who do not drive or have access to a car. It is more environmentally friendly because it has the potential to reduce the numbers of vehicles on the road. However, the public transport use can be affected by a number of factors such as mechanical failures and environmental issues. It may be expensive to use for some individuals and crowded during rush hours. Using the car can be more flexible for some individuals. A car can be useful for effective performance of many tasks. It is easier to change routes when circumstances change unexpectedly.

The professor, however, disagrees with points made in the article and explains that this system has its own disadvantages.\n\nFirst point the professor addresses involves the reading's assertion that creating two or three teams situated in different geographical locations will help reduce the work hours for each team and at the same time it will decrease the time frame of getting the project done. The professor refutes this point of view by saying that based on his own experience this team work could be not so much beneficial. For instance, some group could have questions, but it would not be able to ask the other group because they would sleep at that time. Therefore, the working group will do its assumptions and may cause a waste of time. Moreover, the group in California may do work in one way and a group in India do same work differently, so it will be challenging to bring both of them to the same way of getting things done.\n\nAnother point from the article that the professor opposes is the claim that telecommunication helps to solve many problems that physical separation would cause to businesses.

The diagram shows a compact structure and the simplicity of the machine; it has three main sections: the feed section, the combustion chamber and the blower(i.e. fan). In the first conic part it is possible to feed with the fuel (i.e. the pellet) that leads to the combustion chamber where the pellet will burn to generate the heat necessary to warm up the air. Beneath the combustion chamber there is the ash tray necessary to collect the ash generated by the combustion of the pellet. As mantion above the heat is necessary to warm up the air that, thanks to the fan, will be blown out to the room in order to warm up the external ambient (e.g. room, bathroom, kitchen...). This is a pretty compact machine but it's not very efficient and very clean. Actually, it produces a high amount of pollution such as ash and exhausted gas that contains micro- and nano-particle.\nLet's focus now on the pellet boiler. The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove, the difference is that instead of a fan here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house, so it's nedded a pump to do that instead of just a fan (the pourpose of a fan and a pump it's the same: move fluid from a point A to a pont B, but in one case you have to move air and in the second case water (they have a different density: water has 1000 times the density of air).\nLike in the stove there is a feed section where you can feed the pellet that will go directly to the combustion chamber (according to the control system) in order to burn it and generate the heat to warm up the water. Now, thanks to the pump the hot water is able to reach the upstairs rooms.\nBasically the two rely on the same methods: burning pellets to warm up a fluid (air for the stove and water for the boiler).\n\n","word_count":382}

However, the lecturer argues against the reading passage. The reading passage mentions three ways to prevent cane toads from spreading, while the speaker offers three reasons to refutes the reading passage.\n    The first point, suggested by the lecturer, is that national fence can not stop cane toads from spreading. The cane toads' eggs and young cane toads can spread to other areas from the streams and rivers. Unless the national fence can prevent the eggs and young can toads from moving through the water way, the fence is useless. Thus, the lecture disputes the idea mentioned in the article that building a national fence could avoid the spreading.\n    The lecturer's second argument invovles capturing and destroying the toads by volunteers. It is argued in the listening passage that untrained volunteers could harm the native frogs which are endangered. Because the young frogs look alike, it is possible that the volunteers will kill frogs other than cane toads. In short, the lecturer questions what is stated in the reading passage that prevent the spreading by volunteers capturing the cane toads.\n    Finally, it is argued in the listening passage that disease-causing virus that killed the toads could be a disaster. The lecturer says that if the virus was bring to the original habitats of cane toads in South America, it will cause ecological damage to the local ecosystem. To sum up, the lecturer doubts the way mentioned in the reading that specially designed virus could specifically harm cane toads and prevent them from spreading.\n    To conclude, the lecturer discords with the ideas in the passage by presenting three convincing reasons.

{"index":257462,"grade":"C","full_text":"I'm writing in response of the letter the professor Collins wrote to you.\nIn the letter he complaints about the out-of-date system of schools in Italy and he made some suggestions about how this could be overcome by major educational reforms.\n\nFirst of all, the professor says that the majority of Italian teachers are not well prepared to do their work and, consequently, students don't achieve the skills they should to success in a future work, but I don't agree with this statement.\n\nI think that the real problem that makes our schools so out-of-date comparing to that of other countries is the way teachers get in touch with students and transmit them their knowledge. As a matter of fact students are often seen as empty pitchers ready to be filled by as many information as they can contain. Teachers shouldn't talk about their subjects without caring if their students are really listening to what they're saying or not, and they shouldn't let them study just because they must. They should make their students live school as a pleasant experience, as something their future is based on.\n\nSecondly,in his letter the professor suggests that schools should spend more money on computer equipment. I agree with this recommendation because I think it's important for schools to make the same progresses the society does year by year, offering always new materials and technologies, such as computers or interactive whiteboards in classrooms, making studying more interesting and sometimes also easier.\n\nThis is what, in my opinion, must be changed in schools to satisfy the society necessities and overcome the old and inappropriate 'out-of-date' system.\n","word_count":271}

We can personalise our needs and wishes, such as listening to songs, talking to our friends and family members, eating and drinking and stopping for food or toilet needs anytime, anywhere.\nOn the one hand, public transport is more convenient for large cities as it provides service to a larger number of people and we avoid traffic jams and the need to find parking spots, besides the fact that we won't get worried about leaving our cars parked on the street and, when we come back, the car could have been robbed or stolen.\nOn the other hand, cars tend to pollute more than electric trains and such problem ought to be taken into consideration when someone has to decide between using public transport or a car. The world is getting smaller for people with so many cars around; it's about time everyone thought about the community and not about themselves.\nThe government ought to plan campaigns to make people aware of that and try to find ways to reduce transport fares.

Just after the French Revolution. It is an adaptation from the original book 'Les Miserables' by Victor Hugo. \n\nThe idea lying behind the story is that justice and law are not the same thing. The main character, Jean Valdjean, played by Hugh Jackman, is jailed for stealing a loaf of bread, in a try to avoid his nephew's death. Then after being left free, he become a thief again, however this time he is not condemned because of a prier. But do not worry I am not going to spoil the ending.

It is a news programme based on well researched facts and offers a wide range of all the important information you need.

{"index":146812,"grade":"C","full_text":"Government jobs carry with them serious responsibilities. It is therefore no surprise that a person\u2019s age and experience come under scrutiny when positions in government need to be filled. Many feel influential government jobs should be reserved for those who are older and have more experience, while others feel the criterion for these positions should be capability, namely whomever is most able to carry out the job. This essay will look at both sides before drawing a logical conclusion.\nOn the one hand, many argue that younger people should be made ineligible for important government positions, and the implications of this opinion are clear. Those operating at senior levels within a country\u2019s military, for example, require field experience to prevent disastrous decisions that could cause the needless loss of life. Were younger people allowed to fast track their ascension within a country\u2019s military, they could find themselves having to make critical choices based more on theoretical study than practical experience, and this could have catastrophic results. Thus, is it understandable why many feel younger government workers should be incubated before given promotion to important positions.\nHowever, there are several plausible counters to this argument. For one, younger workers bring creativity and fresh ideas to government. For example, young government workers in Canada successfully pushed to increase HIV understanding and dispel stigmas attached to the disease in the 1980s, a development that encouraged tolerance and reduced irrational fear. In addition to fresh ideas, it should be remembered that to get a government job, one has to successfully engage a rigorous screening process. If a younger person engages this process as well or better than an older person, it is hard to argue that age should be a decisive factor when offering employment. It is clear from these reasons that there is merit to awarding important government career options to younger people.\nAlthough the above look reveals solid evidence for both sides of the argument, it is felt that the healthiest approach to designating government positions is to ensure candidates fulfil rigorous training programs. Thus, a person\u2019s age should not be considered a universal precursor to the awarding of government jobs.\n","word_count":359}

{"index":127255,"grade":"C","full_text":"I think it is fair to say basketball is one of the most popular sports on the planet, both in number of viewers and players. There is probably an array of motives to explain such phenomenon but for me that happens for one particular reason; the shot clock. The shot clock is a timer that dictates the amount of time during which one team can maintain possession of the ball. The idea behind it is to quicken the pace of the game and preventing it from becoming stalled. A corious fact is that out of the five most popular sports in the world only basketball keeps track of possession time and to me that's exactly what sets him apart from the others.\n\nWhile watching or playing any kind of sport, there's nothing worse than a team or a player trying to waste time untill the clock runs out, the game becomes dull and boring and you can't enjoy the excitment that only the uptempo style of play can provide. The bottom line is; a fast paced game is a much more exciting experince for players and viewers as opposed to a slow paced one and that makes the 'shot clock' fundamental to the dynamics of the game.\n\nAnd for anyone trying to become a good basketball players the two most important things to understand (as it is for most sports in general) are the values of practice and awareness. Practice is the one thing that can increase the probability of desireable results and awareness is what gives you the ability to adapt to different situations, and the combination of the two is the only way to success, so if you want to be a good player you need to put your energy and focus on practice and stay alert and surveing the court at all times so you can be aware of what is happening around you.\n","word_count":317}

It is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or plants; there are endangered spices in that area or have a significant importance in history.\nWorld Heritage is the designation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such, have been inscribed on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy.\nThe site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located, but it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the site for future generations. Its protection and preservation becomes a concern of the international World Heritage community as a whole.\nAnother advantage for a site to be inscribed on the List is that once a country signs the Convention, and has sites inscribed on the World Heritage List; the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation. Greater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties. A country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites.\nThe Disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage List are that these sites are not funded so they can't protect them for risks.

Besides, I have undertaken an internship at the HSBC Risk in order to gain an insight into the banking industry and learn how to work with my peers in a business environment. I have gained a better understanding of the role credit risk plays in the full picture of banking operations. \n","word_count":205}

One of the most renowned romance films based on the Shakespearean play was directed by Franco Zeffirelli in 1968. This flick  stands out from low quality versions because of its accurate details. The script is a faithful translation of the original text and the plot, as well, sticks to  Shakespeare\u2019s work. \n\nThis remarkable story is set in Verona in the 15th century. The film, instead, was shot in central Italy and surprisingly the scene of the balcony hasn\u2019t even been filmed in Verona. It\u2019s about the tragic fate of two young lovers whose families are bitter enemies. Romeo and Juliet fall in love and secretly get married. The young bridegroom then is involved in a brawl and banished from the village. The play becomes tremendously thrilling until the couple\u2019s death.\n\nThe acting of a classic is undoubtedly a difficult task, and yet Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting play their role very convincingly. Believable costumes and location, unforgettable soundtrack and outstanding performances celebrate a gripping and moving story that will charm you.\n\nIf you fancy travelling back in time, don\u2019t miss this piece of art. It\u2019s worth it!\n\n","word_count":224}

It was the day when she was going to meet her biological mother. She knew she was adopted since she was 7 years old because her parents told her about it. She did not feel bad about it because she loves her parents very much and she feels loved by them. After her 18th birthday, Anna felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened to her bilogical mother and why did she gave Anna away.

Even though it was illegal, the lady gave her the name and the contact phone number of Sara Fielding, her biological mother. A month passed by before she had the courage to dial that number. She hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother\u00b4s rejection. After a few seconds, a woman picked up the phone. At the beginning Anna did not say anything, she could not utter any sound. But then she said 'hello, my name is Anna and I think you are my mother'.

There  is more than one way to look at this statement. The use of  public transport has a lot of advantages, but on the other hand, some disadvantages can be distinguished. It depends on where and what kind of place you want to reach and it depends on the time of the  day\n In this article both sides are discussed. First what are the advantages of using the bus, or train? When traveling to city centers, choosing public transport is to be advised, because parking a car in the city is really expensive and it is very hard to find a space.  When in the center and wanting to enjoy various sights, by car it is hard to get from on place to the other, because the circulation is dense. IN that way it will take a lot of your time, while the bus or tramway have their own bus lanes, and hence are running smoothly. In that case the choice for public transport will be preferable. \nWhen  traveling to rural areas, it  is quite difficult by public transport, because sometimes there is hardly any no train or bus  for the far out places and the tiny villages. Another problem might be the timetable. Because not may people going to these places, the schedule will be very tight and the bus will only leave once every hour. If there  is a bus or train available, it will stop at almost every village. Most of these buses will make many stops which makes it even more time consuming. \n\nIn the end of the day you should choose public transport or car according to the purpose of your trip. And sometimes public transport is better and sometimes using the car is better.\n","word_count":308}

Most of these, in fact, have very predictable plots, are full of cliches and since it's so easy to figure out how they will end, they are usually very boring. This is why I was very surprised when I came out of the theater after seeing 'Looper' and thought 'Hey, I just saw a thriller with Bruce Willis in it, and it was actually a really good one!' \nThe story is set in the future, about thirty years from now, when time travel had been invented but was used only by criminal organizations who sent those they want killed in the past where a professional killer, a looper, was waiting for them and for the silver strapped to their body. The main character is Joe, a looper who has to face an older version of himself sent back in time to be killed. By letting his older self go Joe changes his past, and therefore his future, leading to a series of unexpected events, and to an even more unexpected ending!\nMy expectations were not very high, but I have to say the movie was surprisingly good, in fact it was not boring at all, and had a few big twists which took me completely by surprise. \nTime travelling is only a means to the development of the story, and the future society is quite similar to the present one, so even if you are not big science fiction fans, I suggest you give this movie a chance, I am sure you won't be disappointed. \n","word_count":283}

There are some that do not need too much forces and strengths, such as Thai chi and others that need more like Karate, Judo , and so. These kinds of sports have some advantages and disadvantages. \n\nthe First advantage of martial arts is to improve self-confidence. When you practise martial arts, you learn how to protect yourself against any sudden attack. You will get ready to fight with others, regardless their strengths, ages and so on. When you do a technique successfully on your opponent, you feel more confidence. Second advantage of doing martial arts is how to respect others. Every time, you do a technique  you have to show your respect to opponent, and also  other ranks, regardless to their age. Third one is movement and coordination between different parts of body; eyes, hands and legs. When you do a technique or defense against a technique, you control your body\u2019s movement and coordinate them to work in the same time.\n\nSome people think there are some disadvantages like injury, and getting aggressive. According to studies, martial arts have fewer injuries than other sports like soccer. People who practise martial arts are less aggressive because they practice to control their inner energy, and also to respect.  \n\nI suggest that everyone should try martial sports. But before starting, you supposed to evaluate your needs and your health condition. And when you are starting, follow the discipline and find the ideas and thoughts that are hidden behind the movements and techniques. In the other words, try to understand the philosophy of the sports before learning the techniques.\n\n","word_count":283}

One of these places is, undoubtedly, Kazimierz, the Old Jewish district of Cracow.\nIn this small part of Cracow, you can meet with Jewish culture and the architectural style.  First, you should visit the New Cemetery. It was established in 1800. For those who enter it will be an \u2018unforgettable\u2019 experience. You walk among ancient, fallen tombs shaded by high trees of great age.\nThen, you really must visit the synagogues: The Temple Synagogue, Isaac Synagogue, The Tall Synagogue and Remuh Synagogue. The synagogue is still being used as a place of prayer for the few remaining Jewish people in Cracow or for visitors from Israel or other parts of the world.\nFor the history lovers, I recommend going to the Historical Museum of The History and Culture of Jewish People. It is the oldest synagogue in Poland and was constructed in the XV century. Inside there is an impressive number of handicrafts, graphics and paintings.\nFinally, you can do shopping on The New Square, a round trading hall. You can buy there almost everything: fresh fruits, vegetables, and household products. On Sundays, the gamut of products is much more bigger. If you are a good browser you may find some original souvenirs of Cracow to take home with you.\nI think the Kazimierz is one of the most beautiful places in Poland.

Not to mention the huge advantage that people are protected from earthquakes because these houses do not have direct contact with the earth. This idea is more than brilliant!\n  When it comes to their jobs, people work on earth, like oldtimes. The way they go to work is worth knowing. They have cars, not like the cars people from 2014 were used to, but they still call them this way. These cars can go down to their destination and then, go up again until the driver pushes a button. This button is called 'find me and come to me'. The name says it all. Once the button is pushed the car finds the driver and literally picks him up. \n  The streets look all new and improved. Lots of the buildings are skyscrapers and the architecture has completely changed. People are still human beings and act completely normal. They seem happy with the way they live and embrace the change in everything.\n  overall, this is an image of the future. Now let's return to the present because we have a lot of work to do if we want to live in that kind of future eventually.       \n","word_count":321}

The marathonetscoming before or staying after the competition can take the advantage of visiting the city, which offers a great deal of facilities\n\nThere are two separate communication networks in the city, that of the waterways and that of the narrow streets. Public water buses and private water taxis run 24 hours a day although less frequently at night. The main centre can be reached very easily. Despite the private service is very expensive it is efficient.\n\nFour and five stars hotels are located in the main area, but smaller hotels and a youth hostel are also available to families.\n\nHotel receptions and travel agencies are always ready to help their guests with a wide range of information on the city's entertainments, exhibitions and so on.\n\nSightseeing and excursions with private local guides are available on request.\n\nIn addition to this there is a significant lack of evening entertainments in the city such as theatres, cinemas and night-clubs.\n\nOn the contrary participants will find a wide range of restaurants, trattorias and bars with a good selection of menus suggesting local food.Some of these restaurants can be quite expensive.\n\nIn conclusion I think there will be no obstacles and objections to host this sporting competition in my town which on the other hand is also a cultural event for many of the participants.\n\nYours faithfully\n","word_count":286}

We encourage people commuting to nearby places to walk or use a bicycle depending on the distance and those going to the same areas outside the town to join car pools.

We distribute jute bags annually with our community logo on it so that people can use them instead of plastic bags. Each year, we encourage school-going children to plant trees to teach them the importance of trees in safeguarding our environment so that they can grow up to be responsible towards the environment. We encourage people who come up with any innovative thoughts about how we could further protect the environment. Besides this, we often visit our neighbouring towns and educate them on the issues of global warming, the threat to ecological balance etc., and guide them on how to protect our environment.\n","word_count":255}

It is also important, though, not to underestimate all the educational possibilities that it gives you, as sometimes you can learn more from a documentary than from a school book. \n\nWhat emerged from the discussion we had in class, is that plenty of students spend their free time watching useless reality or TV shows, procrastinating instead of studying for school.\nAs it is a very common phenomenon between teenagers, schools should show them that television also enables you to learn something new. A clear example is that watching television in another language is of vital importance if you aim to learn new vocabularies or improve your comprensive skills, and it makes studying a language really fun and enjoyable.\n\nOn the other hand, it is difficult to focus and pay attention while you are in front of a TV screen. Getting distracted is extremely likely, therefore people watching educational programs may end up switching the TV off or turning over to another channel, as a good movie or any other entertainment is way more appealing.\n\nHad I choose whether considering television educational or not, I would definitely say it is.

I\u2019ve done some research to find out the best savings account for you. Below you can find a few suggestions of mine.\nThe Phone Bank might give quite a good offer for you. Firstly, the rate of interest is by 3.1%, which is quite good. Additionally, if you open a saving account in that bank, you will get a diary as a gift. And you do not need to pay any annual charges for having a credit card. Unfortunately, the bank doesn't have branches in Britain. And all banking operations must be done by phone.\nThe second bank, Royal Savings Bank, has many branches in the UK (over 650), so you can make all bank operations on spot. But there is a service charge for owning a credit card (\u00a312 per year). You do also get a gift as a new account holder, a full set of saucepans (do you really need it?).\nAll in all, I would recommend you to open your first serving account in the Phone Bank, since the rate of interest is higher and you don\u2019t need to pay any annual charges. And doing operations by phone are actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English.\nThe final decision is yours.\nTake care and see you very soon,\nYours Agnieszka\n\n","word_count":239}

The river Danube divides Budapest into two parts. Margit Island is a favourite destination for runners and lovers. The island boasts fresh air and clear parks. Buda castle is an impressive ancient picturesque building and attractive tourist location.\n\nTransportation system\nRegardless of the mode of transport, fares are very affordable.

You can rent bikes.\n\nFacilities\n\n1.) Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc stadium has ample seats for the spectators. It is suitable for 68976 people.\n2.)

The government should renovate the buildings which would be a great shelter for homeless people. The police chief should reinforce their patrol officers to tackle the crime.

Students usually find it very inspiring and engaging to discuss this issue  because it is very difficult to give a clear-cut answer and so, it makes the process of discussion very exciting.  \nThere may be  a significant number of arguments which support the statement that fame is a good thing.   My personal attitude to fame is rather ambivalent. On the one hand, I personally think that the desire to become  famous is a great driving force that stimulates  people and brings a lot of benefits to others in  its wake. Sportsmen are one of the most vivid examples  of it. If  we take football clubs, for  example, we can see that the desire to become well-known and popular makes football players very dedicated sportsmen. They  can fight against the odds to be in the top league. It is remarkable how much stamina and spirit can be  demonstrated by such sportsmen. Their desire to be at the top contributes a lot to the fame and reputation  of their clubs and countries as well.  What is equally important and adds to the importance of fame is that  somebody's  desire to be famous can have a triggering effect on  others. It means that other people feel challenged and don't want to fall  behind and look  underdogs. Without  this  stimulus  they may   have been inactive.   \n\nOn the other hand almost equal number of people may   maintain  a contrasting point of view. They  give examples when the desire to become famous made people aggressive and ruthless. Such people  tried  to achieve their goal irrespective of the means. I can illustrate my words by the example of military campaigns. The desire of some country's leaders to become famous and to glorify their names as great commanders brought about wars and  conflicts between countries. Hundreds and thousands of innocent people may fall victim to the insatiable desire of such fame -seeking personalities.\n\nSo, all in all, we can not answer this  question as 'yes' or 'no' because there is almost equal number of examples that help to support the contracting points of view. \n","word_count":360}

Parents, in some cases, are mentors to children. However, considering the complexity of the society, I believe it better to learn in schools rather than from parents.\n\nFirst of all, there is no denying that parents may teach their children enormous fundamental living skills, on which their progeny count. Nevertheless, the skills are not diverse enough for children to deal with specific problems when living in a complex society. For example, one of my senior high school's classmate had encountered communication problem involved in the other's family. As a consequence, they never talk to each other since then.\n\nFollowing the previous paragraph, there will always be people of different living styles, attitudes, and beliefs in every aspect of one's life. Have we not lived and learned the skills in a group, especially in school, we will not be skilled before entering the society. \n\nThe society as a whole is a place where both competition and cooperation take turn continuously influence every member. If we only live in our original family, parents will probably forgive us when we make mistakes. In contrast, living in a society is another story: people might blame, compete, or even hurt others no matter who you are. Learning in schools, however, provides valuable opportunity for children to learn not only from teachers, but also from relationships between peers, and as a result, proves the way for being independent in the future. \n\nIn a nutshell, there is a great deal of knowledge needs to be gained for children in order to live in a society.

Some Pro-choice groups and individuals believe that a person have to right of choice, this includes the right to decide if they want to give birth or not. Contradicting the Pro-choice groups , Pro-life supporters consider terminating any pregnancy unjustifiable. Even though in some circumstances, such as life threatening and sexual abuse pregnancies, it could be the best thing to do. Hence, every woman must be able to have abortion as a choice.\n\nAbortion can be given as an option in life threatening.pregnancies. The presence of a mother is important in a child\u2019s life especially in the first few months. During the first months , he relationship between a mother and a child rapidly develops. The baby's inborn capacity of imitation and regulation of visual and auditive stimulation, is gradually patterned and this is supported by the mother's empathetic response. (Lier.l,1988)  This natural process would be interrupted by the absence of the mother and the child\u2019s development could be in this case negatively influenced. Development of emotional and psychological problem such as maternal deprivation can be a result. The child will have difficulties building and sustaining relationships during adult-life. Because of this risk abortion can be considered an option. Besides, abortion could also be considered in case of impregnation as a result of sexual abuse.\n\nImpregnation as a result of sexual abuse is not uncommon and in these cases abortion should be a choice. Sexual violence has a devastating impact on victims, all areas of a victim\u2019s life is affected . Recovering is a hard and complicated  process and when you add a pregnancy to this equation it just makes it even more painful.  In fact, this is the main reason why sexually assaulted victims choose to have an abortion. Many victims believe that the additional trauma related to carrying their rapist child can be avoided by terminating the pregnancy, and therefore help them put the assault behind them and recover more quickly. Even though, not all victims will choose to have an abortion it has to be given as an option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if, abortion has to be given as a choice in special cases, it is not a solutions for  accidental pregnancies. It is for  the person who decides to have coitus to make sure to use appropriate anti conception.  Otherwise, you may run the risk that people seeing abortion as an easy way to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy. In order to prevent this, it is important to apply strict guidelines regarding situation where abortion is given as an option.\nAbortion only has to be approved as an option in life threatening.pregnancies  or if the mother has been sexually molested. Undeterred by this, it still the mother\u2019s decision if she wants to save her own life or carry  and care for her rapist child.\n\n","word_count":476}

If we focus on the teaching of English as a foreign language, we possibly could see this more clearly. In the early 1980s the activity in the classroom was focused on grammar. However, speaking, listening activities and the massive use of I.T mark the schedule nowadays. All these changes make the learning process much more fun, creative and practical for the students. \nThe new teaching approach is based on how students can effectively use the language rather than on the knowledge of the language they actually have. This new outlook on the teaching procedures consists of the use of the so called alternative assessment as a way to evaluate learners\u00b4 skills. A grammar test shows knowledge about the language, whereas alternative assessment shows learners\u00b4 ability to efficaciously use the language in the context of a real situation.\nThere are many reasons for using alternative assessment techniques: learners demonstrate things learned, take responsibility, motivation may increase and they have the opportunity to use language for actual purposes.\nIt is important to notice that the difficulty to carry out the changes towards the new teaching approach- referred to above- lies not with the students themselves but with the old generation of teachers, since they sometimes have trouble applying the new outlook on education methods.\nIn conclusion: The way of teaching is changing in the last few years all over Spain. The main reason for that could be found by overlooking the matters related to new teaching methods developed recently. However, a smooth transition to the new approach is still necessary to overcome the massive education-related challenges Spain will have to face in the upcoming years.\n\n","word_count":302}

Bond, Morton and Braakhuis (2012) also argue that nitrate is considered a potent vasodilator. The reason for this is that the nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels and dilates them, which helps the blood flow more easily and lowers blood pressure. Thus, the induced vasodilation may affect both systolic and diastolic  blood pressure after the exercise. Nevertheless, a study of The New England Journal of Medicine claims that only the diastolic blood pressure is affected by nitrate supplement, once it was not found in their study a significant change on systolic blood pressure after nitrate supplementation in healthy volunteers. Surprisingly, the current study has found significant changes in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure post exercise. Thus, the investment on research about the influence of nitrate supplementation should continue, the aim of which would be to improve sports performance and improved quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that supplementation of beetroot juice has no significant effect on 700 m rowing ergometer performance. It is unquestionable that some research found  significant improvements. In this present study, however, the rowing time of the participants was not shorter than times without supplementation. Importantly, it was not found serious changes in blood lactate levels either. It was assumed that beetroot juice would increase the oxidation and would reduce the lactate production. Nevertheless, the nitrate supplementation did not change the lactate level significantly. Finally, it was confirmed that nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels, consequently reducing the blood pressure. By this action, beetroot juice may effectively protect the cardiovascular system during exercising. Despite the present findings, it is necessary more research to understand the effects of nitrate supplementation. By this action, athletes may improve their performance as well as quality of life.\n","word_count":317}

But with a heavy heart I have to agree with this statement. Why? There might appear a few situations, when shopping instead of joy can bring a headache. \n\nFirst of all, it is quite hard to enjoy shopping when you are forced to do it. The best example here could be the regular, every-week filling-the-fridge shopping, which in principle cannot be pleasant. Personally I am not able to find anything exciting in hanging around extremely high supermarket shelves and pushing heavy trolley.  Crowd in every corner, awful and unpleasant lights and the necessity to run from one end of the market to another, because these shops are organised in the way, which forces you to see everything, in order to find what you really need.  That and the extremely long queues for the cash desk also are not very encouraging. \n\nWhat is more I hate do shopping when I really need to buy something. Because there is this wicked, unwritten rule, according to which if you are looking for something, there is not the slightest chance you will get it.  You will not be able to find the right size, the right colour or simply anything which would suit your taste. \nShopping with your husband, boyfriend, father or any representative of the male kind, also can totally ruin the most fruitful shopping ever. I believe they are genetically programmed to take away all your \u2018joie de vivre\u2019.  The constant grumbling, regular checking the time, this anxious and adrift facial expression \u2013 how on earth it could create a favourable conditions for shopping?!

You just have to avoid supermarkets, buy clothes in advance \u2013 so there will not appear the situation, when you need something really badly and it is not in your closet, and of course of  the male company, better choose the female companion.\n\n","word_count":374}

Those are my findings and my recommendations.\n\n1- Facts and Findings.\n\n- The unrivaled place for young people is the municipal center for youth. This innovative center has a lot of first-class facilities for young people. It has a professional rehearsal studio that local music groups can just rent for pocket money, they can also rent instruments by paying a small refundable deposit. A small cinema, a library, games rooms, a TV-room with an enormous flat screen TV where teenagers usually watch football matches, a basic gym, and a little arena.\n\n- The second best place is a private disco for youngsters. It was renewed last year and regulars like it a lot. The main problem is the high price of the tickets. Kids have to pay 10 euros just for the entrance getting anything else.\n\n- There is another place where local youth spend a lot of hours the new and magnificent mall. It has 150 stores and about 40 fast food shops. They especially like the music store and a magnificent t-shirt store owned by two local designers, there you can design your own item and collect it the following week.\n\nThese are the main places where young people usually go.\n","word_count":223}

I believe we can decline the number of homeless people in Japan by providing them with information and skills.\n\n Those who become homeless usually do not know that there is a system to help poor people. For example, if they do not have enough money that is needed to have home and to buy things necessary to live, they can get a financial support by government. However, those who do not know about it cannot get such support. Homeless people tend to unable\u3000to collect information because of lack in means to do it.  We need to let them get information. \n \n Skills are also needed to get a job. The skills include the ability to communicate with people and to conquer hardships. I have seen a TV program about homeless people. In the program, one homeless man quit his job because he could not have a good relationship in the office. He tried several jobs but he could communicate well in none of them. He was tired of himself, lost interest in working and became homeless. Then, he came to know that there was a class that provide homeless people with skills of cleaning floor for free. He decided to join the class. Sometimes the lesson was hard, but the staff there praised him when he did well. Little by little, he grew interest in working. He came to know how pleasant it is to overcome hard situations. He also learned to how to build a good relationship with people through talking his fellows. He finally wanted to find a job again. If more lessons like this are provided and more homeless people get the skills, the problem of homelessness will become less serious.\n\n To conclude, giving information about support that they can receive from the government, and skills is very helpful way to solve homelessness in Japan. \n","word_count":326}

This change makes most people have to work every day even using their private time, so they need to find out the best way to save their time and fill their energy after work. Fast food is one of ways to solve that problem. This essay will examine some advantages and disadvantages of eating fast food.\n\n\n      There are huge positive effects of eating fast food. First of all is convenience. People who have just done their work are very hungry; they cannot go to home and cook their diet meals by themselves but their bodies need to be provided energy in order to sustain their lives and continue their jobs, so junk food is considered the best way to solve the hunger. To make it clear, the bosses, who are always busy in their business, usually eat fast food, they go to KFC or Lottie Mart to buy them they even might get fast food by phone because of fast delivery. In addition, Junk food is very easy to be found out. There are numerous stores and restaurants which have junk food built everywhere. Therefore, finding a good place to buy and enjoy a meal with fast food is not so difficult and it will not take time for people to go back their work on time.\n\n      On the other hand, eating fast food frequently may lead to some negative effects on customer\u2019s health. Firstly, fast food is unhealthy. Junk food contains large unhealthy chemicals such as high percentage of fat and cholesterol which are the most reasons leading customers to obesity and cancers. According to scientists they said that people who usually eat plenty of junk food will have more than 50% of risks to get obese and even die soon. Furthermore, most of junk food just solves hunger in a short time and then it will quickly return to the customers after they have felt full. Finally is the loss of traditional meals. People prefer buying and eating fast food to making a healthy meal. As the consequence, they gradually forget how to cook a simple meal and the diversity of healthy food is slightly gone.  \n     In conclusion, there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of fast food. Some advantages are that fast food can help to save time and deal with the temporary hunger for white-collar-worker, but it can also harm their health. The customer should be careful before they choose fast food to be a part of their daily diet.\n\n","word_count":430}

The city is thriving on implementing new measures to achieve the Council's goals. The analysis will consist of evaluating the Council's eco-friendly proposals.\nIn accord with the aforementioned, the amount of garbage produced during the years 2007 and 2010 more than doubled, 86% of it discarded inadequately. This is due to the low effect of the 'Recycling Worms' program over the disposal problem. 'City X' incinerates hospital residue, in accordance with legal requirements, and send 7% of the garbage production to recycling factories. The recycling factories have a joint venture with the municipality to sort waste, and show a result 20% better than last year. The program represents 2% of the employment in the city, but it needs to expand.\nThe city has many projects such as the 'Keep it clean, keep it beauty', whose goal is to promote proper disposal in the public areas. Another important one is the 'Let's make it green', responsible for increasing the green areas within the city in 150% during the last two years, consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of rural and communal areas. A later crucial activity are the 'Green Communities', currently carrying 38% of the total amount of consumed vegetables in the metropolitan area.\nA municipal waste policy that integrates private and public sectors and the community is required to solve the current problem. The city needs a joint venture to support a functional and sustainable commerce of recycled rubbish. The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the USED report of 2012 and also fits in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future. Most of the 'Recycling Worms' problem is caused by this lack of training, which can be resolved by training offered in the surrounding universities.\n","word_count":362}

In this period of time, the Caucasian race felt superior to the Afro-Americans, they had the control and they were in charge of the political and economic activity, while the Afro- Americans did the hard work; as shown in the movie, most of the men where in charge of the crops. They did not have a chance to receive any kind of education at all, it was absolutely forbidden, and that is why they could not aspire to more important jobs.\nAfro-Americans were completely segregated, Caucasians found it impossible to live among them, that is the main reason why each race had their own church and their houses where separated to.\nAfro-Americans were afraid of raising their voices to express their inconformity against the oppression they were suffering, and to fight to obtain equality was not an option because any sign of rebellion was cruelly punished.\nMoreover, women in the Afro-American society where threatened in the most denigrating ways, men were the undisputed authority in the house.

However, as a disadvantage, we must consider the cost of studying abroad, because it can be rather expensive.\nTo sum up, the best way of learning English, or rather the best place to do it depends on each person\u2019s means and learning style, but definitely it is possible to acquire a second language both at home and abroad.\n\n","word_count":190}

This means I can actually go places. \nIn a few hours time, I can get to some far-away destination.  I can make it a quick trip, too.  \nI can go to Paris for a long weekend, for example.  The plane will get me there quickly so that I can have\ngo shopping, eat some lovely French meals, drink lots of wine and return before work on Monday. \n\nBoats trips are long and boring.  I went on an Alaskan cruise in 1997.  It was freezing cold and most of the time we \nwere just sitting on the ship with nothing to do but eat.   I also got sea sick.  I definitely don't recommend it.\nTrains are also boring, unless you take a bullet train, and I get motion sickness. \n\nTherefore, when it comes to speed and being able to go places, planes are definitely the best type of transportation available.   \nI highly recommend a plane trip as soon as possible.\n","word_count":193}

So the problem for me is the way the movie is made, with several changes from the original script. Furthermore, the main actors\u2019 performance is not very good because they are not completely inside in their roles.\nAlthough there are a lot of things which could be improved, not everything is bad in this movie!

One of the biggest disadvantages of being popular is that they are on everybody's lips. Public loves to know everything about their idols and they always try to find out some spicy details.\nEveryone deserves privacy, but public figures should be aware of the fact that the society wants to know about them as much as it's possible. Whether they like it or not, they should be prepared for photographers and journalists trying to chase them in every single moment of their life. It might be hard, but they need to be patient and try not to care about the people who interferes with their personal being.\nIn my opinion, journalists and paparazzi shouldn't stalk celebrities on their private holiday or try to get into their intimate life. There are some borders that shouldn't be crossed. For example, when a popular film star goes to hospital because of his relative's illness, reporters and photographers in particular should stay away and leave the celebrity alone.\nEven though they are well known, they have a right to have a free time and they should be albe to use it however they want to without anyone disturbing them. It's really important for people to know the bound between curiosity and nosiness. We should respect other's right to privacy and let them live their own lives.\n\n","word_count":249}

I would like to answer some questions from the guideline on Moodle, to explain how this course helped me to improve my English. So, the first two questions are: Has my writing improved and how did this happen? And the other questions: Which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process? \n\nSecondly, has my writing improved and in what way did this happen then? From my point of view, my writing definitely has improved from the beginning of this school year till now. I discovered that I know many more words than I thought and I can make well-structured sentences now, which I couldn\u2019t do so well at the beginning of this school year. This has to do with the technical grammatical features I learned in class as well. The way I see it is that I learned to use cohesion in a correct way, which makes the paragraphs that I write more clear. Besides that, I use cohesion which I didn\u2019t use before this course. A few examples are: from my point of view and it seems to me. \n\nSubsequently, I would like to answer the next two questions.

Although I believe that I already have improved my English since the beginning of the school year, I\u2019d like to improve my English vocabulary. As I see it, the bigger the vocabulary, the better the writing process. More words can be add in the article, so there can be a better explanation of the subject. It\u2019s my belief that the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process. I learned a lot of new words during the presentations, which I used in my free writing. \n\nTo finish, I can conclude that this English course has been very useful to me, because it has improved my English very well. The way I see it is that the grammatical features learned in English course, always can be used later on in life. For example, when there have to be sent letters in English. \n","word_count":389}

Thank you very much again for helping me getting the tickets for the concert in London but unfortunately I have bad news for you today. I was so excited about going to London and seeing you again. But only until yesterday! My professor told us that our final exam in this course would be on July 5th. As you know I'm not the best student and I've already failed in this exam twice, so there is only one more chance and I have to take it this semester. Otherwise I will be taken off the university register. To be honest I got really mad at him because I really wanted to go to London and I also already got tickets for my flight.\n\nYou don't know how ashamed I feel now, not only for you because you helped me to get the tickets (and I can imagine how difficult it must have been) but also because you have already arranged everything to make my stay in London as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. \n\nDo you maybe have a friend who you would like to go with to the concert since we can't go together? I would let you the ticket so at least you have the chance to enjoy that event even if it isn't with me. I'm sure it will be lots of fun going there! Otherwise I could sell both tickets and we can have a look if we want to go to the same concert here in Germany. The band is not so well known here and the ticket sale hasn't started yet.\n\nSorry again for all those circumstances!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nClaudia\n","word_count":293}

Now the question uder discussion is whether public transport has future as travelling by car is gaining more and more popularity because of its advantages. Well, I think it has future. \n\nFirst, there are always lots of people who would prefer not to give much thought where to park their car or how to avoid traffic jams. The metro, which is a means of public transport, solves all these problems. In smaller towns without underground  there are usually a number of bus routs to cover the city area, so, all you need is to go to a bus stop and to get on a bus and soon you'll reach the destination. One shouldn't forget that using public transport helps to save money. It's not a secret that gas, insurance and reparings are costly. \n\nSafity issue is very important also. It is obvious that  is safer for the environment than thirthy cars with  an only person inside. You should take into account that thirty drivers(often inexperienced or aggressive) pose a greater danger to road users than  than one trained bus driver who feels responsibility for his passengers and for other participants of the traffic. The answer is evident, I think.\n\nAnd the last but not the least thing is that there are quite a lot of people who are not able or just don't want to drive, so the only way out for them is public transport. Moreover, cities' authorities encourage development of public transport because it creates employment, lessens impact on the environment and contributes to road safity.\n\nSo, my opinion is that public transport does have the future. Travelling by car is convenient but public transport has undeniable benefits for long lasting life as well.\n\n","word_count":300}

It contains twelve tracks to enjoy that you wait impatiently for the next song. That fascinating album surprises not only the variety of subjects but also the strength of instrumental sounds.\n  The first single, 'Brave', is a chart-topping song about emotions such as fear and fight. The arrangements are simple and effective and the powerful voice plays harmoniously with the rich sound. It is bound to be at the top of my list. False alarm, which is the second track, is totally different and mysterious because of wealth of musical instruments. Groban sings well-known from the film 'Once' song called 'Falling slowly' in his own fantastic way but listeners get used to the first version might be disappointed. Musically satisfying 'Happy in my heartache' tells the story of tragic love. \n  Once again, Groban fascinates audiences from all over the world with his mature voice and catchy tunes. I definitely recommend that album to your collection. It's a must!\n","word_count":179}

It is true though, that  public transport would not be the general public's first choice. Sometimes the reasons for doing so are not to do with convenience but, rather more to do with economic issues or matters of conscience.\n\nIf we think selfishly, then the car is the obvious choice. It is easy, fast and ,we can almost park it right outside our destination or at walking distance -shorter rather than longer. It is initially expensive but it is so handy that we end up thinking it is part of us and  even think we cannot live without it.\n\nRaising people's awareness of  pollution and how we must have a more sustainable existence is what makes us look for other less selfish and handy options. Publis transport is always going to be slower, less flexible and much less convenient but we have the reassurance that we are doing what is best for our planet. We are complying to the norm.\n\nIn conclusion, public transport  will always have a future if local governments have policies to promote it. It is never the attractive option, but it is the one which shows more solidarity.\n","word_count":210}

As a result, some sources of energy like nuclear power are used for our daily life. But, is nuclear power good for us?\nLet\u2019s begin by considering the arguments in favour. Huge amounts of energy are generated by nuclear reactors. Moreover, they only need a small quantity of fuel to be produced. Fossil fuels are our most common energy source, even though, they produced a terrible effect on global warming on account of releasing gases into the atmosphere. They won\u2019t last forever and this will increase the use of nuclear energy. Just look at oil, nature takes millions of years to form it and we have almost ended it.\nLet\u2019s turn to the arguments against. Nuclear power plants have a high risk of pollution in case of accident. In addition, they produce nuclear waste which is a major problem for the environment and public health. \nAll things considered, I believe that renewable energy will be the most common energy in the future as it doesn\u2019t damage global warming although it is expensive to afford.\n\n\n\n","word_count":194}

Through the years, my interest in machines and electrical devices increased, so whenever a device stops working I tries to fix it before calling the maintenance, and my parents always encouraged me even when I broke it down.\nWhen I was in secondary school, and my friends were dreaming of be Doctors or Dentists, I decided that I will be an electrical engineer or mechanical engineer, so I entered the scientific branch. During my study, my parents and I noticed that I understand kinetic physics more than electrical physics. Also, I was good at mathematics subjects that related to solid geometry, that is why I decided to study mechanical engineering.\nSince I enrolled in the faculty of mechanical engineering, I had a goal to complete my master study in Europe or America. After searching and asking, I found Germany has numerous prestigious technical universities, and it offers great study atmosphere for foreign students and supports them in many ways. Moreover, Germany is one of the biggest industrial countries in the world and it has many huge factories. Additionally, the living costs are quite affordable.\nFor those reasons, I am convinced that Germany is the best country to complete my study abroad.\nI have been working as a teacher of mechanical materials in a vocational school since my graduation. I really like this profession and how good it feels to spread science and knowledge to new generations. Therefore, I have decided that I am going to continue my postgraduate study and pursue a Ph.D. degree to work as a teacher at a university.\nI have been looking for a while for suitable university to apply to. I read about TU-Clausthal and I decided to apply to it for many reasons. First, I like the curriculum of the mechanical engineering master program. Second, TU-Clausthal has very good rating in engineering at many websites like ranking.zeit.de. Third, TU-Clausthal gives conditional admission and it has a language center. Finally, TU-Clausthal located in fascinating nature.\nI hope that I get the chance to complete my study at your university and to gain practical experience in one of the greatest industrial countries in the world.\n\n","word_count":386}

All the participants, which were ten in total, were given a personal computer for the duration of the entire course in order to put into practice what was taught. Furthermore, the organizers had carefully planned the whole course, including meals and beverages too.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n\nThe tutor, Will Reeves - a lecturer of the University of Cambridge, succeeded in covering the whole program in an extremely effective way. To begin with, he focused on design considerations with DPT, explaining what software to use, and then he went on to tell us about typography and fonts, layout and balance as well as graphics and logs. Therefore, he concluded the course by making color considerations and showing proofing and printing. The highpoint, however, was the final practical exercises which gave us the opportunity to test our comprehension. \n\nFAILURES\n\nDespite the strengths mentioned above, there were also some areas that required some attention. Not only was the venue inconvenient but it was also dirty. The general dissatisfaction was perceived by the lecturer too, who pointed it out to the organizers who immediately started looking for an alternative venue. In addition, in spite of having paid a lot, the participants were not allowed to take any materials away, and this resulted in obtaining a less effective result as the participants didn\u2019t have any materials to use to revise. \n\nFINAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nTo sum up, the course was generally successful, as the positive feedback received suggests. In conclusion, we would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in this subject for both the quality of the course and the unquestionable preparation of the tutor. \n","word_count":325}

Success in a job depends on the amount of theoretical knowledge that a person had in academic institution. In addition, every phenomenon is based on theory. When employees face any problems or difficulties in work, it must be referred to the theory that explain this phenomenon, without knowing this theory employees can\u2019t overcome these difficulties, for instance, engineering science seems practical, but each part of engineering science is based on theories. Thereby, engineers must take demanding knowledge to be successful in a career. \n\nSecond of all, theoretical qualifications are crucial for employees, as it helps t people to think and solve all problems in a fair way. Scientific approach is more important to deal with problems, beginning with determining problems and then studying all factors and related information. Then employees are able to suggest the best solution, this approach is  developed in formal education.

Think of  the Olympic Champion Nadia Comaneci ,artificially stopped in her physical development   to preserve her graceful childish body.\n   Equally cruel, it is, in my opinion, to accelerate the pace of growth by forcing .children to work like adults or by inducing little girls to dress and behave as femmes fatales in video-clips or magazine covers.\n   Nature is also change, but in a cycling direction, and in a natural rhythm : the movement of celestial bodies, the rotation of Earth, the alternation of days and nights, the sequence of seasons\u2026, in short, the wheel of life.\n  We lived in a time of accelerated changes. Technology allows us to do and learn in one life\u2019s time more things than our ancestors were able to in several generations. But at the same time we are working against Nature \u2013 let\u2019s think of pollution and climate change \u2013 and against our own human nature: distress, allergies, strokes and heart attacks are nowadays more and more frequent.\n  I think we should readjust the rhythm of change in order to be able to reinterpret, in a positive sense, Lampedusa words \u201ceverything must change so that everything can stay the same\u201d.\n\n","word_count":359}

I was excited to get back into the classroom, I mainly teach online today, and try out some of my new skills on a group. I checked the equipment: I had a computer and projector, both in good working order, a fast internet connection and a full class.  I was ready and raring to go.....\n\nAs soon as the lights went out, the atmosphere changed in the classroom and I felt the tension rise. One student said that she couldn't see well, another student complained that the writing was too small, another felt she was getting too hot from the projector. The group's native language is Amharit; they have all had to learn Hebrew, so English is a third or for some of them a fourth language.  I'd chosen a method of teaching that was not suitable for the group.  This is a group of beginners, the experience of a first lesson with a new teacher is daunting enough, without adding unfamiliar technology and teaching methods. So I switched off the projector, took out my white board pen, dusted off my flash cards and reverted back to traditional methods of teaching.  \n\nWe've had three lessons so far and I'm thoroughly enjoying teaching this group; it's a pleasure to teach face-to-face and a challenge to teach adults at this level; it's really great to get 'back to basics'.    This experience has reminded me that although there are many advantages to using technology in the class room, it's not always appropriate and it's helped me to establish some equilibrium in my teaching methods.\n\nInstead of creating some online lessons for this  wonderful group, I have taken the opportunity to create some new printable materials to hand out in class. \n\nThis post will be the first of three on the topic of the Present Simple tense, it contains a printable infographic covering the basics of the Present Simple and two printable worksheets. \n","word_count":361}

My school friends and me went to Dominican Republic, it's a Caribbean country with amazing beaches. Even though I don't like places like that, I rather enjoyed this trip a lot. Maybe it was because I was with my friends and I could find many ways to spend my time with them or it could also be the great environment. I remember we got there the first of October on a Saturday night, and I will never forget the rush of warmth I felt as soon as I stepped out of the plane. First, I thought that it was something else causing the warmth, but later on I learned that the weather was like that all the time and I just had to get used to it. When we got to the resort we all checked in and went to our designated rooms. I was sharing a room with my friend Emily. After unpacking we left our room to see the rest of the resort. We found a club, 3 big pools, sports fields and, of course, the amazing beach, though we couldn't see much of it because it was really dark at night. The next day, we made sure to go to the beach early and we had a blast with our other friends. This went on until the last day of our trip. We were, obviously, sad because this amazing time was ending but happy as well for the memories we shared together. I will remember this vacation for the rest of my life.\n","word_count":274}
{"index":95609,"grade":"C","full_text":"To: The Chairperson\nFrom: Teodora Costescu, Romanian student\nSubject: Local Environmental Protection\nDate: 13th September 2014\n\nPurpose\nAs requested, this is a report concerning the environmental condition within my town. The information below evaluates the chief measures taken against pollution and environmental damage as well as the population\u2019s interest and involvement in an optimum preservation of the area.\n\nRecycling\nThrough a series of programmes and events organised by local voluntary organisations both adults and children are instructed about the importance of waste reduction and recycling. Therefore, in the last few years there has been a great improvement in raising awareness and commitment among an increasingly larger sector of the population as far as the selective collection of household refuse is concerned. This is clearly illustrated by the growing number of recycling facilities the residents of our town have at their disposal. \n\nPublic Transport\nSince exhaust fumes are considered to be one of the major pollutants nowadays, the local authorities are doing everything in their power in order to induce citizens to travel more by means of public transport, in the detriment of the ubiquitous private cars. Consequently, there are buses which run at short intervals on various routes, so that people can arrive at their destinations rapidly and conveniently. Unfortunately, only a limited number of people are willing to leave their comfort zone for the sake of the community, thus making pollution by dint of heavy traffic a remaining and inextricable problem of our society.\n\nPublic Cleaning Services\nOur local public cleaning services are responsible not only for the efficient removal, storage, collection and transport of waste material, but also for the maintenance and good care of natural areas and green spaces within our community. The sole purpose of their activity is to keep our town clean and neat, making it an appealing and pleasurable place to inhabit.\n\nConclusion\nTaking everything into consideration, it would be fair to conclude that there are numerous ways in which one can protect the environment and take care of the area in which they reside. However, as with all issues present within society, a dual commitment from the citizens and authorities should be regarded as a key factor.\n     \n\n\n\n","word_count":364}

Therefore, Jake tries to arrange his stays with one goal in mind: travelling in a comfortable way but saving as much as possible.\n\nA few months ago month he had been spending two weeks in Brussels. He was following an important European summint on environmental issues. \nBrussels, Europe's capital, made his stay very pleasant. Jake was able to enjoy its multicultural environment and its great cultural initiatives. He could easily move from place to place at very convenient prices. Access to sevreal public transport services (such as underground, buses, tram, etc.) let him reach his working meeting always on time. He also had the chance to know more about the diverse atmosphere characterizing each and every Brussels' suburb. During winter Brussels might be quite cold.However,metros and buses are equipped with such a powerful heating systems that you forget about the cold.\n\nA few weeks later, Jake had to travel to the South of Italy to follow the case of immigrants reaching the coasts of Europe via sea from Africa and the Middle-East. He was so excited about that trip. Italy is his parents' country of origin and it was the first time for him to visit Italy. He was able to reach the South by a connection flight from Rome. It was spring, the prefect time to go and visit South of Italy. Nevertheless, his stay was not as pleasant as he had thought. Jake's main challenge was to move around and reach the places he had planned to visit both for his research and for tourist purposes. He soon came to realise how disorganised public transport is in the South of Italy. Its inhabitants move around exclusively on their own cars. Towns are congested by traffic jam, especially during rush hours. He was surprised by the poor quality of the air when walking around. The air was polluted by smog due to the huge number of cars. Jake could only move around by using the few expensive taxis available.\n\nSuch experience made Jake realise the considerable impact that a good public transport system has on people's life and their surrouding. In particular, an efficient public transport impacts on:\nStress - it makes your life easier since you avoid driving in the middle of traffic jam\nCommunications - it eases movements from place to place\nEnvironment - it reduces cars on the roads, therefore air is less polluted\nYour own and your community's pockets!? - access to public transport is way cheaper than taking care of your own car; though initially it might look like a huge disbursment of money from the community, in the long term it shows to be the most efficient way to travel!\n\n","word_count":500}

That is the reason why our class attended a panel discussion on this specific topic. Different ways of accumulating and storing information were presented at the discussion. I would like to emphasise two options in this essay.\n\nOne way to get the information needed is to interview people from the neighbourhood and either write down what is being said or record it as an audio-file. This way you do not only gather plain data but also emotions from people. Additionally, it happens that while speaking of a particular event suddenly more memories and stories come to the narrator\u2019s mind. However, sometimes the narrator tends to fill in the gaps of his\/her memory with imaginary parts or tries to embellish certain parts of the story.\n\nAnother interesting way to find out more about the past is to collect old photographs.

Once a curious novelty that was largely considered a harmless addition to our sometimes dull and overly familiar environment, it was welcomed as fun and informative. It was also - if one wished to do so - relatively easy to ignore.  But we have now entered a new era of the attention-grabbing business: its digitalisation. \nTheir transformation from innocent posters to digital screens ranging in size from miniscule to vast has made adverts all-pervasive. Researchers say that an average adult in the developed world is now exposed to hundreds of commercial messages every day.\n\nThose involved in this lucrative business are in awe of the almost endless possibilities that recent technological advances offer them. Multimedia, advertising and entertainment companies now work in synergy to target everyone from toddlers who can barely speak to pensioners confused with the speed of life in the new age, unsubtly playing on their needs and desires in order to turn them all into faithful consumers. \nThey have so successfully infiltrated their own product into our everyday existence that we no longer see it anymore as what it really is: a nuisance. Creators of adverts have long given up on informing the consumers and instead opted for seducing them. The result are insincere, misleading and often deceitful messages that our minds are saturated with.\n\nPerhaps it is time to do an experiment and hit a pause button and reflect upon this subject matter.  Imagine a world without adverts, for a week at least. Would it be bleak and boring and leave us at a loss as what to buy, or might it just turn out to be a long yearned for respite?\n\n","word_count":297}

When there are students with varied levels in English, it may be challenging for teachers to prepare for or deliver the course. Here are some of my solutions for this issue. First of all, determining the needs of the students is always the top priority. While conducting a need analysis, you can have a general picture of learners\u2019 motivation in learning English. After that, teachers are supposed to use partnership and grouping exercises and activities in order to meet individual\u2019s needs. Through teamwork, students with varied levels can cooperate and learn from each other through discussions. It is beneficial for both the upper and lower achiever because they can assist or get help from each other. Differentiated instructions, giving different tasks for the same activity, are proved to be necessary in a class with varied levels of students. Teachers can assign tasks which have different levels of difficulty, or different numbers of tasks to students with different levels. Moreover, instead of using a core textbook, or using different levels of textbooks, carrying out a theme-based approach is more appropriate, and it also saves teachers\u2019 preparation time.

Needless to say, in order to combat the rising tide of the social problems in Hampshire, the Education Authority decided to increased funds for the educational sector.\nSports Club\nSportive activities might boots the student's overall condition and this is the reason why they are necessary. It is well known that physical activity contributes to improving physical and mental health.\nDrama Club\nThis kind of club will allow students to express their feelings in a non-violent manner, learn how to manage their reactions and develop creative talent. A drama club will make examining plays such as Shakespeares' more enjoyable than solely studying them will. \nCookery classes \nCookery classes are very important because students here are young adults that need to have basic skills such as cooking or order to manage themselves and live an independent life. Cooking classes will helps students spend less money on eating out and they will start eating healthier because by making their own food they will be more aware of what they are eating.\nDYI Classes\n'Do it yourself' classes improve practical skills. As most college students will soon leave for university and will live in dorms, without their parents, they are oblidged to solve malfunctions by themselves. The information they acquired during these courses will help them for the rest of their lives. \nCitizenship classes\nAnother kind of classes that are necessary are citizenship classes as teenagers nowadays are deficient in this field. These courses will develop the civic sense of students and they will start involving actively in society.\nConclusion\nThe overall purpose of these actions is to keep young adults in school and to educate them. The Education Authority believes that social problems are linked with a decrease in participation in extra- curricular activities and it suggests that the college should use extra funding to solve this issue.

Most people think that choosing a grammar school is the best option, because it opens the door to university, while technical institutes are put in a corner. That is actually a mistake, because the schools who best prepare students to working life are technical institutes, who emphasize the real world applications of the studied subjects through laboratories and industry experiences. Conversely, grammar schools extremely focus on theory. In fact, students learn lots of formulas and principles without actually linking them with one another in order to use them in real life. I think that problem should be addressed.\n\nSuggestions\nWhat I would suggest in order to deal with this problem is to integrate more laboratory experiences also in grammar schools, like chemistry experiments or bacteria observation with microscopes. Furthermore, schools should offer a year in industry for students in the last two years, which would not only teach them a lot more than school only would, but it would also attract more people to the school itself.\n\nConclusion\nPeople should get used to the fact that most companies will also care about your previous work experience, and the idea of gaining that through school would be really appealing.\n","word_count":255}

{"index":121148,"grade":"C","full_text":"Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am writing in response to the article about friendship that was published in your magazine. I would like to share my feelings about a particular friendship that is highly important to me and furthermore evaluate the reasons why is especially complicated to maintain long lasting friendships in any situation. \n\nFirst of all, as far as special friendships are concerned, I must say that I am not a person who makes friends easily, consequently I do not have a large circle of friends. However, I can portray a unique relationship that I have with a generous and warmhearted person. Although it is true that this is not a long term friendship I can admit that I have found a true friend. Throughout this friendship I have been given the support, the affection and the confidence to pursue my dreams. On the other hand, friendship is a two way street where you receive and give back the same favors and, naturally, I enjoy doing so. I value this friendship and is of great importance to me because it is a balanced one of a kind relationship. \n\nSecondly, I would like to say that maintaining friendships over time entails strenuous effort. A justification for this may be the fact that over the years people change and grow apart. For this reason not all childhood friends grow older as close confidants, simply because they are not the same people as they were before. As you gradually grow up your world expands, your personality changes and so do your acquaintances. However, the natural process of aging is not the only change we undergo but there are others such as enrolling in school, getting our first job or changing the old one, travelling or moving to another city. All this situations may impede us to stay in touch with old friends but on the other hand can give us the opportunity to make new ones. \n\nTo summarize, I would like to say that even thought we are incapable to remain on friendly terms with everyone we should know that the process of socializing is one of the factors what makes us human and we should always embrace it. \n\nYours faithfully,\nAllison Green\n\n","word_count":371}

Everyone lived peacefully and harmoniously until one day, at the welcoming ball in honour of the  little princess, a horrendous witch showed up and cursed the little princess named Sophie, who would die at the age of 16 and only a kiss of true love would save her.\nPrincess Sophie grew up, she was so unhappy because she couldn't do anything, she was condemned to live in a room of the castle until someone could find the cure for her cursed. One day she figured out how to escape through a hidden passage, she got to the town and ran and jump, she did every little thing she wasn't aloud to since so long. While she was having some fun, a handsome boy crashed her and she fall to the ground. As only a gentleman would do, he apologised and introduced himself to the Princess:\n- I am so sorry Madam, excuse me for my blunder. I am Michael.\nThe princess was a little scared of talking to someone she didn't know, because she never got to talk to anyone before, but still she answer him with a big smile-You are excused, my name is Sophie.- It truly was love at first sight. Michael asked her to go with him for an ice cream so he could amend his fault.\nSophie accepted and they started a strong friendship that through the time became in more than just a friendship, they fall in love for each other. \nPrincess Sophie used to escape so she could meet with Michael, until one day, when she was  just about to meet Michael to confess him all the truth about who she really was, a guards discovered her and the King commanded to lock her up in her room.\nMichael was disappointed because he thought that Princes Sophie didn't love him anymore.

{"index":81032,"grade":"C","full_text":"Myths and facts about frozen shoulder\n\nFrozen shoulder or shoulder stiffness is an extremely limiting and debilitating disease. The condition starts with pain when you move your shoulder joint and then progresses into total failure and limitation of the shoulder. Although very important and critical, there are lots of myths surrounding it and many patients suffering the disease do not know the real facts about it. Today we will make a spotlight on the famous facts and myths about \u201cFrozen shoulder\u201d.\n1-\tMost of the patients believe they have got frozen shoulder due to a trauma or injury in the shoulder joint, but this is a myth because frozen shoulder can occur after a trauma or even without any trauma as in elderly people especially those who have diabetes and those recovering from an operation. \n     \n2-\tIf you believe that doing exercises worsens your condition, then that is another myth because frozen shoulder occurs to people who stop or decrease using their shoulder joint for a long time. Usually after major operations, having a stroke or bone fracture. They ignore using full range of joint motion to avoid the pain sensation. So an inflammatory response starts leading to the joint stiffness, movement becomes painful and range of movement is limited by time.\n\n3-\tAn important fact about frozen shoulder is that no surgeries are usually needed. The first treatment that your doctor will suggest is medications such as analgesics and paracetamol. In addition to this, physical therapy is also an important way of treatment to maintain a full range of movement. Cortisone injections are also helpful, these injections can improve everything; decrease swelling, stiffness and pain. Surgery is our last resort if the condition is severe and all the previous lines of treatment failed.\n\n\n4-\tIf you believe that you can easily prevent frozen shoulder, then of course you are right. You can never have a frozen shoulder if you followed these advices:\n\n-\tIf you had a surgery or an injury, you should keep moving your shoulder joint within a limit even if it is painful.\n\n-\tHaving physical therapy after a surgery or trauma is crucial. Physical therapy returns your body to its previous healthy condition before trauma. If not done, healing is not fully completed and the joint remains painful. Therefore, further avoidance of movement occurs and leads to frozen shoulder.\n\n-\tPhysiotherapy is not only about exercises, some physiotherapy techniques can decrease your pain and suffering.\n\n","word_count":410}

Unlike popular understandings of History (and even presumably scientific ones, I must say), History is not an unstoppable march towards 'progress', whatever that word means. It is a ciclical process. Rome had its hayday in the first century AD, but just three centuries later it was only a shadow of its past. Those later period Romans weren't even able to make the high quality cement that their ancestors were able to make and have technical mastery over just a few centuries earlier. And who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take  for granted? No one can assure such a thing. But I don't think, unless there's another World War, people's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years. I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak, and after that there will be a decline, until a new Dark Ages. But let's pick the World War hypothesis for a second. A wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in peoples lives in the time length of 50 years from now. But there's, at this day, prospects for a new World War? I don't think so, but on the other hand what the hell do I know? The causes that will lead to a new World War may well be in existence right now for all I know, and no one, or only a few very wise and intelligent people know about it. One day in the future another Franz Ferdinand could be killed, and that symbolic event could serve again as an escuse to some country declare war to another, but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war  against each other would have its roots in  much older times. As the causes of the Second World War had its roots on events that were the outcome of the First War, a Third, hypothetical war, could have its roots on a past conflict that may well have  happenned already. \n But let's not digress into that, that's all another topic that falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition. \n","word_count":394}

An individual must be aware of the result of his act on the environment, be it due to personal or professional act, in order to maintain it in healthy state. In Clayton, my hometown, people are fond of maintaining the environment and they actively participate in encouraging the ones who try to work towards its progress as well as in protesting against the ones who tend to cause harm to it. \n\nThe municipal board of Clayton conducts meetings fortnightly to communicate about the improvements that have been made and that have been planned to be implemented in future in the town. Representatives elected by respective communities attend the meeting. It is then their responsibility to communicate the message to all members of their community. These meetings are organized according to their planned schedule and the results were surprising. Earlier, regardless of whether the rubbish was recyclable or not, it was disposed off in the same bin. Later, people were educated regarding recyclable, non-recyclable and organic waste and were also informed that the rubbish was to be disposed-off in respective bins. This rubbish was collected by the municipal board on a daily basis and proper disposal methods were employed. \n\nDevelopment was also happening at the same time which was good for our town, but, lots of trees were also cut down as a result. People started protesting against them to avoid any further damage to the environment. Hence, the municipal board decided to invite the developers as well in the meeting that was scheduled in a weeks time. In the following meeting, it was decided that on the following Sunday everyone will be planting a tree that will be provided by the municipal board for free. On the following Sunday, as discussed, trees were planted and before we realized, they started adding beauty to our town. \n\nTaking care of environment is everyone's duty and it must be performed responsibly. The municipal board of Clayton does an excellent job in educating its people to keep the environment in a healthy state. I hope people must take them as an example and introduce similar ideas in their own towns or villages. After all, it is the place we all live in.\n\n","word_count":385}
