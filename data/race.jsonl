If you go shopping for food before lunchtime, you'll probably buy more than you plan to. Unfortunately, however, just this advice isn't enough for shoppers these days. Modern shoppers need an education in how and how not to buy things at the store. First, you check the weekly newspaper ads. Find out the items that are on sale and decide if you really need these things. In other words, don't buy anything just because it's cheaper than usual! Second, never let \"New and Improved!\" or \"All Natural\" on the front of a package influence you. Instead, read the list of contents on the back. Third,compare prices: that is, you should examine the prices of both different brands and different sizes of the same brand.\nAnother suggestion for shoppers is to buy ordinary items instead of famous brands. Ordinary items in supermarkets come in plain packages. These products are cheaper because producers don't spend much money on packing or advertising. However, they are still of high quality. In the same way, in buying clothes, you can often find high quality and low prices in brands that are not famous. Shopping in discount clothing stores can help you save a lot of money. Although these stores aren't very attractive, and they usually do not have individual dressing rooms, not only are the prices low, but you can often find the same famous brands that you find in high-priced department stores.\nWise shoppers read magazine ads and watch TV commercials ,but they do this with one advantage: knowledge of the psychology behind the ads. In other words, will-informed shoppers watch for information and check for misinformation. They ask themselves questions: Is the advertiser hiding something in small print at the bottom of the page?

What is the solution?\"I think cities will make new laws to limit the number of cars people can have ,\" says Golden. \"Instead, people will use taxis, subways, and buses. New technology, like smartphones, can make these forms of public transportation even better. Imagine if everyone had a smartphone and used them to signal  when they wanted to ride the bus.

He owned a large field and wanted to make it a forest.\nThe good doctor had some interesting ideas about planting trees. He never watered his new trees. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants spoiled them, and that if you watered them, each baby tree would grow weaker and weaker, so you had to make things difficult for them and pick out the weaker trees early on.\nHe talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in search of water under the earth by themselves. Deep roots were very important.\nSo he never watered his trees. He'd planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he'd beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention.\nDr. Gibbs died several years after I left home.

However, people in China began to use paper money in the 7th century .\nA Chinese man called Cai Lun invented  paper almost 2,000 years ago. He made it from wood. He took the wood from trees and made it into paper. He then put these pieces of paper together and made them into a book. Now paper still comes from trees. We use a lot of paper every day. If we keep on wasting so much paper, there will not be any trees left on the earth. If there are no trees, there will be no paper. Every day, people throw away about 2,800 tons  of paper in our city. It takes 17 trees to make one ton of paper.This means that we are cutting nearly 48,000 trees every day. Since it takes more than 10 years for a tree to grow, we must start using less paper now. If we don't, we will not have enough time to grow more trees to take the place of those we use for paper.\nSo how can we save paper? We can use both sides of every piece of paper, especially when we are making notes. We can choose drinks in bottles instead of those in paper packets. We can also use cotton handkerchiefs   and not paper ones. When we go shopping, we can use fewer paper bags. If the shop assistant gives us a paper bag, we can save it and reuse it later.\nEveryone can help to save paper. If we all think carefully, we can help protect  trees.

Governments use it to learn where people live and work and to plan what to do with the land. It is now easier than ever to use geography because of a science called space technology.\nThe United States launched its first satellite in 1958. Some space missions that followed were geographical studies. In fact, earth science is a big part of the work of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\nAstronauts looked out of the space shuttle. They decided to take photographs of Earth from their vantage point. Over the years, picture quality improved. Shuttle photography now shows land features, such as rivers. It can even show the streets of large cities. Photos of the same places at different times show how the land is changing.\nNASA does not use just photographs, though. In 1958 it launched TIROS (the Television Infrared Observation Satellite). This first use of a satellite to study Earth was effective in giving weather forecasts. It led to the creation of new space tools to use in geography.\nThe Landsat Program began in 1972. This satellite sent detailed views of Earth from space. The pictures were so precise that scientists could count the number and kinds of crops in a field. Landsat showed where Earth's surface had faults along which earthquakes might happen. This information helped in the planning of new cities and factories. Landsat also made discoveries. In Antarctica it located ranges of unknown mountains. It pinpointed small lakes in Virginia that were no ton maps. Landsat, now more advanced, still flies today.\nAnother space tool is Earth Observing-1 (EO-1). This spacecraft flies right behind Landsat. It takes pictures of the same sites. The two sets of pictures, viewed together, show how cities grow and how other places, such as rain forests, become smaller over time. This helps scientists learn how people affect geography.\nOne of the newest space tools is the Geographical Information Systems (GIS). GIS is computer software that helps scientists to study Earth. GIS is different from earlier space tools.

Governments use it to learn where people live and work and to plan what to do with the land. It is now easier than ever to use geography because of a science called space technology.\nThe United States launched its first satellite in 1958. Some space missions that followed were geographical studies. In fact, earth science is a big part of the work of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\nAstronauts looked out of the space shuttle. They decided to take photographs of Earth from their vantage point. Over the years, picture quality improved. Shuttle photography now shows land features, such as rivers. It can even show the streets of large cities. Photos of the same places at different times show how the land is changing.\nNASA does not use just photographs, though. In 1958 it launched TIROS (the Television Infrared Observation Satellite). This first use of a satellite to study Earth was effective in giving weather forecasts. It led to the creation of new space tools to use in geography.\nThe Landsat Program began in 1972. This satellite sent detailed views of Earth from space. The pictures were so precise that scientists could count the number and kinds of crops in a field. Landsat showed where Earth's surface had faults along which earthquakes might happen. This information helped in the planning of new cities and factories. Landsat also made discoveries. In Antarctica it located ranges of unknown mountains. It pinpointed small lakes in Virginia that were no ton maps. Landsat, now more advanced, still flies today.\nAnother space tool is Earth Observing-1 (EO-1). This spacecraft flies right behind Landsat. It takes pictures of the same sites. The two sets of pictures, viewed together, show how cities grow and how other places, such as rain forests, become smaller over time. This helps scientists learn how people affect geography.\nOne of the newest space tools is the Geographical Information Systems (GIS). GIS is computer software that helps scientists to study Earth. GIS is different from earlier space tools.

Do you agree?\nTo solve this problem, airlines try hard to improve their food. They would like to do so because they don't want to lose customers.\nHowever, according to scientific research, part of the reason why plane food tastes bad is that at high altitude we can not taste things as well as we do on the ground. Also scientists have found that our noses become very dry even before a plane takes off. As the plane moves up, the change in air  pressure reduces one third of the sensibility of our taste buds . So our taste buds become senseless. The sad face, however, is that our noses don't know it.\nAll of these help explain why food on the plane tastes so bad. They also help explain why airlines choose to offer passengers salty and spicy food. Without doing so, the food would be tasteless.\nNow there are many researches on this. According to one of them, some volunteers are asked to lie with their feet higher than their heads for weeks.

{"example_id":"middle1600.txt","question_id":3,"article":"When an animal helps another animal, it usually gets something valuable in return. For a long time, many scientists thought that only people could act generously just because it feels good.\nHowever, a new study in Germany suggests that chimpanzees  also do good things for no real reason. And so do children who are as young as 18 months of age. Maybe it is because humans and chimpanzees share an ancestor  about 6 million years ago.\nPeople and chimpanzees appear to develop such features  without any other training, says Warneken, a scientist in Germany. Warneken and his partners worked on adult chimpanzees that live on an island in the African country of Uganda. They also worked with 18-month-old children in Germany. The researchers performed three experiments on the adult chimpanzees and two experiments on the kids. In the first animal experiment,a person tried to reach his arm into a cage to get a stick,but he couldn't reach it. A chimpanzee was in the cage,and it could reach the stick if it wanted to.\nThirty-six chimpanzees took part in this experiment one by one, and no chimpanzee saw what the other chimpanzees had done. Even though the animals hadn't met the person before, they usually took the stick and gave it to the person. What's more, they did this whether or not the person offered them bananas as a reward. In a similar experiment, 36 children acted in a similar way. They helped the person reach the stick, whether or not they were offered toys for their help.\nResearchers did other experiments on chimpanzees and babies. No rewards were offered in either experiment. And still, both the chimpanzees and children went out of their way to help. Still, the new study is different from earlier findings. Researchers have found that chimpanzees don't give rewards of food to other chimpanzees, even if it costs them nothing to be generous.","question":"Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?","options":["Thirty-six chimpanzees joined in this experiment one by one","No chimpanzee saw what the other chimpanzees had done","The animals hadn't met the person before the experiments","Chimpanzee gave the person the stick in order to get a reward"],"answer":"D"," question_type":"Whole-picture reasoning"}

Or even get ones that run on sunlight! You can also help. Let's try one of these top ideas:\n(1) Try to use less electricity. Turn off lights, your television, and your computer when you've stopped using them. To make electricity, fossil fuels are burned in big factories. But burning fossil fuels also makes greenhouse gases. You should also try to watch less TV.\n(2) Plant trees. Not only is it a fun thing to do, but it is also a great way to lower the number of greenhouse gases in the air. Trees take carbon dioxide out of the air when they grow.\n(3) Don't throw away your rubbish, try to recycle it. If rubbish is not recycled, it is put in the ground.

She says that the way you think is causing some of your illness.\nDoctors and other scientists who study the human mind and try to explain why people act in the way that they do, called psychologists  , are starting to believe it. You know that your brain   is connected to every part of your body through your nervous system  .

Sometimes you don't even want to. _ \nThe link   between your body and brain works in two ways. Your body can help your mind deal with stress.

Another thing that you can do is daily exercise. If you go walking or do aerobic dancing or work out at the gym  , you give your body a chance to burn up some of that adrenaline.

In the past, many doctors didn't accept the idea that anger could be a problem all on its own.\nToday, though, a growing number of mental health experts think that anger is a serious problem that needs its own treatment.\nHow to tell the difference between \"normal\" anger and \"anger problem\" is difficult. After all, everyone gets really mad from time to time. Experts point out a few ways.\nDisordered anger, as it is sometimes called, tends to be of greater intensity  . It takes very little to set off a person with an anger problem, and their responses   are very strong. An example: While most people would get upset if a driver cut them off, someone with disordered anger might try to chase down the car and force it off the road.\nAnd in cases of disordered anger, the person gets angry more frequently and his\/her anger lasts longer. For most people, angry feelings disappear quickly. But people with anger problems often stay angry for days, weeks or even years; their feelings of anger don't disappear over time.\n _ are also important to consider: Disordered anger often damages people's lives. \"It interferes   with people's relationships and their jobs,\" says Raymond Chip Tafrate, a US psychologist. \"Even their health is affected.\"\nAnger clearly increases the risk of certain health problems, as many studies have shown. \"When a person is angry, their heart beats faster and their blood pressure goes up,\" says Howard Kassinove, a professor at Hofstra University in New York. Over time, these changes take their toll on the body, he adds.\nExperts suggest that people with an anger problem take anger-management programs. The programs teach people to control their responses to stressful situations through the use of relaxation techniques. The programs sometimes include life-skills training as well: increasing someone's level of competence  - whether on the job or as a parent or partner - helps bring down stress and cut angry feelings.","question":"Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?","options":["Anger is an secondary emotion that makes people sad and stressed.","Anger was recognized as an illness by most doctors in the past.","A person with an anger problem gets angry more often and easily.","The use of relaxation techniques is the best way to manage anger."],"answer":"C"," question_type":"Whole-picture reasoning"}

Sports drinks are great for athletes,but they have so much sugar that they'll dehydrate you more. However,drinking a few bottles of sports drinks will be good for you.\nSecondly,be sure to take enough breaks to let your body rest. If your coach doesn't let you take enough breaks in the heat,don't wait until you feel uncomfortable. Just be honest with your coach when you need breaks.\nThirdly,when you have a break,don't sit in the sun. With the sun beating down on you,you'll only heat up and sweat more.

In fact, it travels farther on rainy days.\nUsing the red light can help drivers in farther areas see the lights. It helps drivers slow down or stop in time. If drivers don't see the red light until they are close, they may not be able to stop the car in time. An accident may happen. Red can also excite people. We can act more quickly when we see the color red.\nIn a word, red light helps drivers stop in time and help prevent accidents.","question":"The passage mainly tells us?? _? .","options":["why accidents happen","how the red light travels","why we use red traffic lights","how to stop in time at traffic lights"],"answer":"C"," question_type":"Whole-picture reasoning"}

The scientists studied two kinds of bats--the Australian megabat, known as the flying fox, and the Chinese microbat.

Live Below Your Means\nThere will always be temptation to give up the future for immediate pleasure. We all want to buy that new piece of technology, treat ourselves to an expensive night on the town, or take out a loan for the flashy car we can't afford. It might feel great at the time but unwise spending hurts a lot later on. Enjoy life's simple pleasures and save as much as you can. Expensive things don't create lasting happiness and security. Careful spending will bring you greater leisure and enjoyment in the long run.\n2. Put Your Money to Work\nSaving is great, but to make the most of your money you need to put it to work. Good investments can be the difference between retiring in your 40's or in your 60's. A post today at The Simple Dollar really got me thinking. According to Trent's estimates, if a person in their early 20's invests 20% of their income in an S&P index fund, the interest they earn will equal their current salary when they reach their early 40's. They could retire without a drop in income! Wise investing is the surest path to financial independence and it's something everyone can work on. It's definitely an area I'll be devoting more attention to in my personal life.\n3. Educate Yourself\nTo be happy we need continuous growth. The best way to grow is life-long education. This doesn't mean you need to pursue a doctorate or spend 2 hours reading every day. Self-education can be anything that takes you out of your comfort zone. The important part is keeping an open mind and searching for fresh ideas and perspectives. Education builds over time. It might feel like the bits of wisdom you acquire don't mean much, but over the years they add up to form a wiser, kinder, more interesting person.\n4. Develop Lasting Personal Relationships\nSuppose you had everything you wanted. Would you be happy without anyone to share it with? The personal relationships we develop with friends and family members are the greatest source of happiness in our lives. Don't forget about them. Taking the time to cultivate and enjoy personal relationships is essential to long-term happiness.

All you will hear are love, passion, affection, hate and blue, for the feeling, not the color1.\nPeople like using English songs to practice English skills because it's easy and enjoyable. They think that sitting in the car listening to English songs day after day will improve their English skills.

A recent report by Britain's Independent Institute of Manpower Studies, however, disagrees with this. The report states that most employers wish to avoid employing the wrong person. Rather than looking for the right person, they are looking for applicants to turn down.\nThe report also suggests that in Britain and in many other parts of the world the selection methods used to pick out the right person for the job certainly do not match up to those used to judge a piece of new equipment. Employers used three main selection methods: interviewing, checking resume or application forms and examining references. Most of the employers asked in this survey stated that these selection methods were used more for weeding out unsuitable applicants rather than for finding suitable ones.\nInterviews were considered to be more reliable than either resume checks or references from past employers. Research, however, proves otherwise. Interviewers' decisions are often strongly influenced by their earlier judgment of the written application. Also different employers view facts differently. One may consider applicants who have frequently changed jobs as people with broad and useful experience. Another will see such applicants as unreliable and unlikely to stay for long in the new job.\nSome employers place great importance on academic qualifications whereas the link between this and success in management is not necessarily strong. Some employers use handwriting as a standard. The report states that there is little evidence to support the value of the letter for judging working ability. References, also, are sometimes unreliable as they are not very important while checks on credit and security records and applicants' political opinions are often the opposite.\nThe report is more favorable towards trainability tests and those which test personality and personal and mental skills.

All living creatures, especially human beings, have their features, but everything about the little sea cucumber seems unusual. What else can be said about an unusual animal that eats mud, feeds almost continuously day and night but can live without eating for long periods, and can be poisonous but is considered eatable?\nFor some fifty million years, in spite of all its strange features, the sea cucumber has lived on its diet of mud. It is adaptable enough to live attached to rocks by its tube feet, under rocks in shallow water, or on the surface of mud flats. Common in cool water on both Atlantic and Pacific shores, it has the ability to suck up mud or sand and digest whatever nutrients are present.\nSea cucumbers come in a variety of color1s, ranging from black to reddish-brown to sand-color1 and nearly white. One form even has brilliant purple tentacles . Usually the creature are cucumber-shaped--where their name comes from--and because they live in rocks, this shape, combined with flexibility, enables them to press into crevices  where they are safe from animal eater and ocean currents.\nAlthough they have greedy desire for food, eating day and night, sea cucumbers have the ability to become still and live at a low metabolic  rate--feeding a little or not at all for long periods, so that the living things in the ocean that provide their food have a chance to increase by a large amount. If it were not for this natural ability, they would swallow all the food available in a short time and would probably starve themselves out of existence. But the most impressive thing about the sea cucumber is the way it defends itself. Its major enemies are fish and crabs. When attacked, it forces all its internal organs in its body out into water.

Medical workers on board  collect blood from volunteers. The blood is then stored up and given to people  who have lost a large amount of it due to accidents or diseases.\n     Blood  is one of the most important substances   supporting our lives. But for now, the only way we  can get more of it is through donation. And donated blood has its own problems.  First of all, certain blood types are extremely rare. Type O negative blood  (O-), for example, only exists in 7 percent of people, according to Sunday  Times. There are fewer donors and therefore there isn't enough of this type of  blood for everybody who needs it. In addition, donated blood comes from various  people, which means that it has to be examined carefully for disease such as  hepatitis   and  HIV to make sure that it's safe for transfusion.\n     This  is why scientists all over the world have been trying to make blood in labs.  And now, someone finally succeeded--Marc  Turner at the Scottish National BloodTransfusion Service has produced  blood fit for transfusion, reported Forbes.\n     Unlike  many other scientists, who have tried to make blood substitutes by mixing   up different ingredients together, Turner chose to grow blood directly from  human stem cells  . He developed a special technique to create a chemical environment  similar to that in our bone marrow  . This environment encourages stem cells to develop  fully into red blood cell.\n     According  to Turner, his version of artificial blood is unlikely to contain disease  viruses or produce side effects. And the best part is that what he managed to  produce was type O- blood. Not only is it a rare blood type, it's also a  universal type, which means it can be transfused into any patient.\n     The  new blood is scheduled for human tests in 2016. However, Turner stressed that  the new study should not be taken as a signal for people to stop donating blood  because it could be another 20 years before the artificial blood can be  manufactured on a large scale. \"It is one thing to bake a cake and another  thing to bake a cake 100 times the size,\" said Turner. \"It's not just a matter  of putting in 100 times the ingredients.\"","question":"According to the text, a  potential danger of blood transfusion is that  _  .","options":["it is  impossible to store up large amounts of blood","blood  transfusion may lead to some terrible infections","it is very  hard to find matches for certain blood types","blood  transfusion often leads to serious side effects"],"answer":"B"," question_type":"Whole-picture reasoning"}

The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip.\nBut according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service.\nTipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food $2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping.\nAccording to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more.

Criticized to varying degrees throughout its history for its violent nature and high injury rate, boxing has somehow always managed to survive----and even thrive----as a sport.\nModern boxing regulations are based upon the 12 rules set out by British boxing officials in the mid-19th century. These rules became known as the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, named after the 8th Marquess of Queensberry, John Sholto Douglas, who sponsored and published them. In addition to in-the-ring rules, modern boxing also has specific regulations regarding eligibility for the fighters themselves.\nThe modern rules for professional and amateur boxing differ, but both types of contests are divided into time periods called rounds. In professional boxing, each round lasts three minutes; in amateur boxing, two minutes. A one-minute rest period between rounds is standard. Amateur contests consist of three rounds; professional contests may consist of up to 12 rounds. A bell is usually sounded by a timekeeper to begin and end each round.\nA key step in making boxing safer and more respectable was the introduction of gloves, ending brutal bare-knuckle competition. Boxing gloves are heavily padded to soften the impact of the blow and to protect the hands of the boxer. As an added protection, the hands are taped before being placed in the gloves, which are essentially huge mittens.

It means not to affect the child to be what we ourselves want him to become, but to be affected by the impression of what the child himself is; not to treat the child with cheating, or by force, but with the seriousness and true love suitable to his own character.\nNot leaving the child in peace is the greatest problem of present methods of training children. Parents do not see that during the whole life, the need of peace is never greater than in the years of childhood, an inner peace under all outside liveliness.\nBut what does a child experience? Corrections, orders, interference , the whole livelong day. The child is always required to leave something alone, or to do something different, to find something different, or want something different from what he does, or finds, or wants. He is always guided in another direction from the true inner will that is leading him. All of this is caused by our so-called enthusiasm in directing, advising, and helping the child to become the same model produced in one assembly line .

{"example_id":"high18215.txt","question_id":1,"article":"Expressions about water are mostly as common as water itself. \nThe expression \"to be in hot water\" is one of them. It is a very old expression. Hot water was used five hundred years ago to mean being in trouble. One story says it got that meaning from the custom of throwing extremely hot water down on enemies attacking a castle. That no longer happens. But we still get \"in hot water\". When we are in hot water, we are in trouble. It can be any kind of trouble, serious or not so serious. A person who breaks a law can be in hot water with the police. A young boy can be in hot water with his mother if he walks in the house with dirty shoes. \n \"Being in deep water\" is almost the same as being in hot water. When you are in deep water, you are in a difficult position. Imagine a person who can not swim being thrown in water over his head. You are in deep water when you are facing a problem that you don't have the ability to solve. You can be in deep water, for example, if you invest in stocks without knowing anything about the stock market.\n \"To keep your head above water\" is a color1ful expression that means staying out of debt. A company seeks to keep its head above water during economic hard times. A man who loses his job tries to keep his head above water until he finds a new job.\n \"Water over the dam\" is another expression about past events. It is something that is finished, and cannot be changed. The expression comes from the idea that water has floated over a dam and cannot be brought back again. When a friend is troubled by a mistake she has made, you might tell her to forget about it. You say it is water over the dam.\nAnother common expression \"to hold water\" is about the strength or weakness of an idea or opinion that you may be arguing about. It probably comes from a way of testing the condition of a container. If it can hold water, it is strong and has no holes in it. If your argument can hold water, it is strong and does not have any holes; if it does not hold water, then, it is weak and not worth debating. \n \"Throwing cold water\" also is an expression that deals with ideas or proposals.\nFor example, you want to buy a new car because the old one has some problems, but your wife throws cold water on the idea because she says a new car costs too much.","question":"Don't cheat in this exam!

But why go to all that trouble when cities are full of black surfaces already, in the form of asphalt   roads?\nTen years ago, this thought came into the mind of Arian de Bondt, a Dutch engineer. He finally persuaded his boss to follow it up. The result is that their building is now heated in winter and cooled in summer by a system that relies on the surface of the road outside.\nThe heat-collector is a system of connected water pipes. Most of them run from one side of the street to the other, just under the asphalt road. Some, however, dive deep into the groun.\nWhen the street surface gets hot in summer, water pumped through the pipes picks up this heat and takes itunderground through one of the diving pipes. At a depth of 100 metres lies a natural aquifer  into which heat several heat exchangers   have been built. The hot water from the street runs through these exchangers, warming the ground-water, before returning to the surface through another pipe. The aquifer is thus used as a heat store.\nIn winter, the working system is changed slightly. Water is pumped through the heat exchangers to pick up the heat stored during summer.

Though the suicide rate was comparatively high in the early years, his study shows it has dropped in recent years, as opposed to the ascending trend in the rest of the world.\nAccording to Jing's calculation, China's suicide rate had dropped to about 0.01 percent in 2004. In 2009, the figure dropped further to 0.007 percent, which is rather low compared with the global rate of 0.016 percent. Even if the \"missing\" suicides were added, China's suicide rate in 2009 would still be below 0.008 percent.[:Zxxk.Com]\nJing has found that one of the main reasons why the suicide rate has dropped was the steady and big decline in the number of suicides committed by rural women. In the early years, researchers generally agreed that the suicide rate among Chinese women was higher than among men, which is pretty rare in the rest the world. But the suicide rate among Chinese women, especially in rural areas, has declined remarkably in recent years. In fact, it is almost equal to that of Chinese men.\nAs a sociologist, Jing regards suicide as a social issue, and believes improvement of social policies will reduce the suicide rate even further. More people's lives can be saved if the authorities adjust to social environment for the better, he concludes.","question":"From Jing's search, we can see   _  .","options":["China has been ranked among those with the highest suicide rates in the world","in the rest of the world suicide rate has been rising quickly in the last few years","different from Michael R.

Americans do not have a corner on the \"death\" market, but many people feel that the United States leads the world with the worst taxes.\nTaxes consist of the money which people pay to support their government. There are generally three levels of government in the United States: federal  , state, and city; therefore, there are three types of taxes.\nSalaried people who earn more than a few thousand dollars must pay a certain percentage of their salaries to the federal government. The percentage varies form person to person. It depends on their salaries. The federal government has a graduated income tax, that is, the percentage of the tax (14 to 70 percent) increases as a person's income increases. With the high cost of taxes people are not very happy on April 15, when the federal taxes are due.\nThe second tax is for the state government: New York, California, North Dakota, or any of the other forty-seven states. Some states have an income tax similar to that of the federal government. Of course, the percentage for the state tax is lower. Other states have a sales tax, which is a percentage charged to any item  which you buy in that state. For example, a person might want to buy a packet of cigarettes for twenty-five cents. If there is a sales tax of eight percent in that state, then the cost of the cigarettes is twenty-seven cents. This figure includes the sales tax. Some states use income tax in addition to sales tax to raise their revenues  . The state tax laws are various and confusing.\nThe third tax is for the city. This tax comes in two forms: property tax (people who own a home have to pay taxes on it) and excise   tax, which is charged on cars in a city. The cities use these funds for education, police and fire departments, public works and municipal   buildings.\nSince Americans pay such high taxes, they often feel that they are working one day each week just to pay their taxes. People always complain about taxes. They often protest that the government uses their tax dollars in the wrong way. They say that it spends too much on useless and impractical programs.

{"example_id":"high12273.txt","question_id":1,"article":"Most people feel lonely sometimes, but it usually only lasts between a few minutes and a few hours. This kind of loneliness is not serious. In fact, it is quite normal. For some people, though, loneliness can last for years. Now researchers say there are three different types of loneliness.\nThe first kind of loneliness is temporary. This is the most common type. It usually disappears quickly and does not require any special attention. The second kind, situational loneliness, is a natural result of a particular situation -- for example, family problem, the death of a loved one, or moving to a new place. Although this kind of loneliness can cause physical problems, such as headaches and sleeplessness, it usually does not last for more than a year.\nThe third kind of loneliness is the most severe. Unlike the second type, habitual loneliness usually lasts more than two years and has no specific cause. People who experience habitual loneliness have problems socializing and becoming close to others. Unfortunately, many chronically lonely people think there is little or nothing they can do to improve their condition.\nPsychologists agree that one important factor in loneliness is a person's social contacts, e.g. friends, family members, co-workers, etc. We depend on various people for different reasons. For instance, our families give us emotional support, our parents and teachers give us guidance, and our friends share similar interests and activities. However, psychologists have found that, though lonely people may have many social contacts, they sometimes feel they should have more. They question their popularity.\nPsychologists are trying to find ways to help habitually lonely people for two reasons: they are unhappy and unable to socialize and there is a connection between habitual loneliness and serious illness such as heart disease. While temporary and situational loneliness can be a normal, healthy part of life, habitual loneliness can be a sad and sometimes dangerous condition.","question":"How would you treat temporary loneliness according to the passage?","options":["Talk to friends.","Just ignore it.","Go to see a doctor.","Ask your teachers for guidance."],"answer":"B"," question_type":"Detail reasoning"}

Zoo officials say he was a gift for Lord Robert Clive of the East India Company, who was instrumental in establishing British colonial   rule in India, before he returned to England in 1767. Long after the other three tortoises died, Addwaita continued to thrive  , living in Clive's garden before being moved to the zoo in 1875. \n\"According to records in the zoo, the age of the giant tortoise, Addwaita, who died on Wednesday, would be about 250 years,\" said zoo director Subir Chowdhury.

Three windmills  were recently introduced in a Copenhagen neighbourhood, and the city plans to add another 97.\n\"We've made a very ambitious commitment to make Copenhagen CO2-neutral by 2025,\" Frank Jensen, the mayor, says. \"But going green isn't only a good thing. It's a must.\" The city's carbon-neutral plan, passed two years ago, will make Copenhagen the world's first zero-carbon capital.\nWith wind power making up 33% of Denmark's energy supply, the country already features plenty of wind turbines. Indeed, among the first sights greeting airborne visitors during the landing at Copenhagen's Kastrup airport is a chain of sea-based wind towers. By 2020, the windswept country plans to get 50% of its energy from wind power.\nNow turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based. Having the energy production closer makes it cheaper, and land-based turbines are the cheapest possible source of energy available today. Fixing them also makes the locals more aware of their energy consumption.\nThough considerably less attractive than it was in ancient times, the windmill is enjoying popularity in the 21st century. \"Windmills are a symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,\" says resident Susanne Sayers. Meanwhile, fellow Copenhagen citizen Maria Andersen worries about the noise, explaining that she wouldn't want a wind turbine in her neighbourhood. While Copenhagen citizens approve of the windmills, they're less willing to live close to one. The answer, the city has decided, is to sell turbine shares.\nEach share represents 1,000 kW hours\/year, with the profit tax-free. With a typical Copenhagen household consuming 3,500 kW hours\/year, a family buying four shares effectively owns its own renewable energy supply. To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares. Involving the local population was a smart move. \"There are a lot of things you can do close to people if it's not too big and if there's a model where locals feel involved and get to share in the profit. Knowing that you, or your neighbours, own a technology creates a very different atmosphere than if a multinational owned it,\" says Vad Mathiesen.\nGoing green? Yes. Accepted by the population? Yes. Going with centuries-old city architecture? Hardly.\nCertainly, the three turbines don't exactly _ the 18th-century city centre, as they are in a neighbourhood 3 km away. According to the mayor's office, none of the remaining 97 turbines will rise in architecturally sensitive areas. But Sascha Haselmayer, CEO of city creation group Citymart, warns, \"With Denmark being a world-leading producer of windmills, there is a risk that the answer to every energy question is windmills.\"\n\"We've destroyed mountains and lakes in order to support our lifestyle,\" notes Irena Bauman, an architect and professor at Sheffield University. \"Wind turbines are a sign that we're learning to live with nature. I hope we'll have them all over the world,\" she says. \"They may be unpleasant to some, but better-looking ones will come.

The second was, \"'Packaging in the Sustainability Agenda, A Guide for Corporate Decision Makers\", which highlighted the contributions of packaging to the three aspects of sustainability: packaging protects products and prevents waste(environmental aspect); packaging enables efficient business conduct(economic aspect); and packaging provides consumers with the benefits of the products it contains(social aspect).\nPackaging performs indeed a wide variety of functions throughout the value chain and contributes to reducing food waste by protecting ingredients and products during transportation and by delivering family--sized packages.

But sometimes the problem is knowing what to buy. This has led to a type of shopping called \"showrooming\".\nShowrooming is something I've done. I will go to a shop to see, touch and try out products but then go home and buy them online at a knock-down price. I'm not alone in doing this. Research by a company called Foolproof, found 24% of people showroomed while Christmas shopping in 2013.\nAmy Cashman, head of Technology at TNS UK, says the reasons for this new shopping habit are that \"people are lacking time, lacking money and they want security about the products they are buying\". She explains that consumers are not only shopping online at home but they are using the Internet in store or on their smartphones to shop around.\nBut does this mean technology will kill shops? Certainly shops will change. They will have to offer more competitive prices or encourage people to buy more by giving in-store discounts or free gifts.\nWe mustn't forget that buying in a shop means you can get expert advice from the sales assistant and you can get good aftercare. It's good to speak to a real human rather than look at a faceless computer screen, but at least by showrooming, you get the best of both worlds!","question":"The author's attitude towards showrooming is   _  .","options":["critical","neutral","casual","supportive"],"answer":"D"," question_type":"Attitude analysis"}

He listed reasons why he thinks digital textbooks make sense.\nCalifornia approves traditional textbooks in six-year cycles. Digital ones can offer the latest information. They lighten the load of school bags. They save paper and trees, and make learning more fun and interactive. And above all, he said, they help schools with their finances.\nThe state has had to make severe cuts in school spending because of deep financial problems. More than six million students attend California public schools. \nEarlier this year, California invited content developers to offer digital math and science materials for high schools. These had to meet at least 90% of the state's learning requirements. Specially trained teachers examined 16 textbooks and approved ten of them. Six of the ten were published by the CK 12 Foundation, a nonprofit group that had been developing digital science and math books for about two years. The foundation paid teachers and other education professionals to write and edit them. The money came from a group financed by the Khosla Family.\nCalifornia cannot require schools to use the digital textbooks. Individual school districts will have to decide for themselves. Susan Martimo, a California Department of Education official, says she does not expect widespread use right away. Her best guess is that some schools with a lot of technology will be the first to use them, but only in addition to their traditional books.\nSchool administrators point out that the texts may be free online, but students need a way to access them.

But it is a principle both of law and common morality that carelessness is no excuse when one's actions could bring death or damage to others.

Emotional upsets can affect drivers' reactions, slow their judgment, and blind them to dangers that might otherwise be clear. The experts warn that it is important for every driver to make a conscious effort to keep one's emotion under control.\nYet the irresponsibility that accounts for much of the problem is not only caused by drivers.

Safety standards for vehicle have been raised both at the point of manufacture   and through regular road-worthiness inspections  . In addition, speed limits have been lowered.

The method of hiding exact meanings is called coding. People have used secret codes throughout history to protect important information. The National Cryptologic Museum celebrated 60 years of cryptologic excellence in 2012. One event there marked the sixtieth anniversary of the National Security Agency. Two former NSA workers shared their memories of operating a code machine called Sigaba.\nIn 1940, an American woman named Genevieve Grotjan found some information being repeated in Japanese coded messages. Her discovery helped the United States understand secret Japanese diplomatic messages. After the United States understood the code, it was possible to study messages from the Japanese ambassador to Germany and to his supervisors in Japan.\nUnderstanding these messages helped the United States prepare for a possible war in the Pacific with Japan. After the attack on Pearl Harbor. the American naval commander in the Pacific Ocean was Chester Nimitz. His forces were much smaller than the Japanese Naval forces. And the Japanese had been winning many victories. Joseph Rochefort had worked for several months to read the secret Japanese Naval code called JN-25. If he could understand enough of the code, he would be able to give Admiral Nimitz very valuable information.\nFrom the beginning of 1942, the Japanese code discussed a place called \"AF.\" Joseph Rochefort felt the Japanese were planning an important battle aimed at \"AF.\" After several weeks, he and other naval experts told Admiral Nimitz that their best idea was that the \"AF\" in the Japanese code was the American-held island of Midway. Admiral Nimitz said he must have more information to prepare for such an attack.\nThe Navy experts decided to trick Japan. They told the American military force on Midway to broadcast a false message. The message would say the island was having problems with its water-processing equipment. The message asked that fresh water be sent to the island immediately. This message was not sent in code.\nSeveral days later, a Japanese radio broadcast in the JN-25 code said that \"AF\" had little water. Joseph Rochefort had the evidence he needed. \"AF\" was now known to be the island of Midway. He also told Admiral Nimitz the Japanese would attack Midway on June 13.The battle that followed was a huge American victory.  That victory was possible because Joseph Rochefort learned to read enough of the Japanese code to discover the meaning of the letters \"AF.\"\nOne American code has never been broken. Perhaps it never will. It was used in the Pacific during World War Two. For many years the government would not discuss this secret code. Listen for a moment to this very unusual code. Then you may understand why the Japanese military forces were never able to understand any of it.\nThe code is in the voice of a Native American. The man you just heard is singing a simple song in the Navajo language. Very few people outside the Navajo nation are able to speak any of their very difficult language.\nAt the beginning of World War Two, the United States Marine Corps asked members of the Navajo tribe to train as Code Talkers.\nThe Cryptologic Museum says the Marine Corps Code Talkers could take a sentence in English and change it into their language in about 20 seconds. A code machine needed about 30 minutes to do the same work.\nThe Navajo Code Talkers took part in every battle the Marines entered in the Pacific during World War Two. The Japanese were very skilled at breaking codes. But they were never able to understand any of what they called \"The Marine Code.\"\nThe Cryptologic Museum has many pieces of mechanical and electric equipment used to change words into code.

In Afghanistan alone, it is believed that approximately 57 percent of girls wed before the legal age of 16.\nVarious factors drive parents of child bridges to marry off their daughters, from the community's pressure to confirm to age-old cultural customs to economic considerations. In poor, developing nations, it is not uncommon for families to settle debts by offering their daughters as payment.\nExperts agree that early marriage denies the girl education and robs them of their childhood because most young wives, burdened by grownup responsibilities, do not get a chance to interact with their peers or carry on friendships outside the household. In many cases, the girls are lorded over by their husbands and in-laws, leaving them vulnerable  to domestic violence as well as physical, sexual and verbal abuse. Underage wives who are lucky enough to escape from their husbands end up living in poverty, or worse. Most girls who enter early marriages are expected to get pregnant right away, which often leads to tragedy for both the mothers, who are still children themselves, and their babies.\nUnless international organizations take steps to reverse the troubling trend, it is estimated that over the next decade, 100 million more girls--or about 25,000 girls a day ---will marry before they turn 18.\nTo learn more about campaign to end the practice of early marriages, please click: Too Young To Wed.","question":"The UN made October 11 as International Day of the Girl Child in order to   _","options":["urge parents to treat girls equally as boy","call on people to pay more attention to girls' education","call on people to pay more attention to girls in poor countries or areas","start a global campaign against early marriages"],"answer":"D"," question_type":"Detail reasoning"}

Within 50 years the world population is expected to double, while economic growth will continue around the world, especially in the poorer countries.

Sunday was, indeed, different from the other days of the week, because everyone seemed to be on the same schedule, which means that there was one day when everyone seemed to have time for everybody else.\nSunday as a day of rest is, or was, so deeply rooted in the culture that it's surprising to find that, in a short span of time, it has almost entirely lost this association.

According to a new study by researchers at the University of Georgia, such people may be more likely to have food addiction. The study found that people exhibiting impulsive behavior weren't necessarily overweight, but impulsiveness was related to a direct relationship with food, and therefore, less healthy weight.\nFood addiction has been compared to addictive drug use. Studies have linked the dopamine   release that occurs after tasting delicious food to the dopamine release that happens when people consume other addictive substances.\nImpulsive behavior involves several personality traits  . Two of these traits, known as negative urgency and lack of perseverance, were particularly associated with food addiction and high BMI   during the study.\nNegative urgency is characterized by the tendency to behave impulsively when experiencing negative emotions. Some people might drink alcohol or take drugs. For others, it could mean eating to feel better. Lack of perseverance is when a person has a hard time finishing hard or boring tasks. People with a lack of perseverance might have difficulty attempting to change addictive eating behavior, which could also cause obesity.\n\"Impulsiveness might be one reason why some people eat in an addictive way despite motivation to lose weight,\" said Dr. Ashley Gearhardt, a clinical psychologist. He was involved in developing the Yale Food Addiction Scale in aid of those people. \"We are theorizing that if food addiction is really a thing, then our measure, the Yale Food Addiction Scale, should be related to helping control impulsive action,\" said Gearhardt.\nClinical psychologist Dr. James MacKillop, whose lab was conducting the study, believes that therapies used to treat addictive drug behavior could help people who suffer from addictive eating habits.\n\"Most of the programs for weight loss at this point focus on the most obvious things, which are clearly diet and exercise,\" MacKillop said. \"It seems that managing strong desires to eat would naturally fit in with the skills a person would need to eat healthily.\"","question":"What can be inferred about the Yale Food Addiction Scale from the text?","options":["It has been successfully carried out among overweight people.","It might help some impulsive people with food addiction to lose weight.","It will prove whether food addiction is a problem to impulsive people.","It is theoretically a proper treatment for addictive food and drug behavior."],"answer":"B"," question_type":"Detail reasoning"}

Earlier, we were infants and young children, and consequently more vulnerable  ; later, we shall undergo a progressive loss of our vigour and resistance which, though vague at first, will finally become so steep that we can live no longer, however well we look after ourselves, and however well society, and our doctors, look after us.\nThis decline in vigour with the passing of time is called ageing. It is one of the most unpleasant discoveries which we all make that we must decline in this way, that if we escape wars, accidents and disease we shall eventually \"die of old age\", and that this happens at a rate which differs little from person to person, so that there are heavy odds in favor of our dying between the ages of sixty-five and eighty. Some of us will die sooner, a few will live longer -- on into a ninth or tenth decade. But the chances are against it, and there is a virtual limit on how long we can hope to remain alive, however lucky and physically strong we are.\nNormal people tend to forget this process unless and until they are reminded of it.

But these are not similar or equivalent to what happens when man ages. A run-down watch is still a watch and can be rewound. An old watch, by contrast, becomes so worn and unreliable that it eventually is not worth mending. But a watch could never repair itself -- it does not consist of living parts, only of metal, which wears away by friction  . We could, at one time, repair ourselves -- well enough, at least, to overcome all but the most instantly fatal illnesses and accidents. Between twelve and eighty years we gradually lose this power, an illness which at twelve would knock us over, at eighty can knock us out, and into our grave.

{"example_id":"high15166.txt","question_id":1,"article":"A lazy Susan is an addition to a table that is designed to assist in moving food from one person to another while dining. This is achieved through the use of a turntable  , which usually moves the food in a circle when it is pushed by those at the table. In this way, the food never has to be picked up and passed around the table. Instead, it remains in place on the lazy Susan.\nA lazy Susan may also be a part of a kitchen cabinet  . In this sense, the lazy Susan is a type of shelving unit within the cabinet that is able to turn around its axis  . One may turn the lazy Susan in order to find certain goods in storage. From the outside, a lazy Susan appears to be two cabinets that are located at a right angle   to each another. When one of these cabinets is pushed, however, both doors move and the lazy Susan is revealed inside.\nIt is believed that Thomas Jefferson invented the lazy Susan in the 18th century, though it was called \"dumbwaiter\" at that time. It is said that Jefferson invented the lazy Susan because his daughter complained she was always served last at table and, as a result, never found herself full when leaving the table. Others believe that Thomas Edison was the inventor, as he is believed to have invented the turntable for his phonograph  . The turntable may have developed into the lazy Susan later.\nRegardless of who invented it, it wasn't until 1917 that the term \"lazy Susan\" was used in an advertisement for the invention. In Britain, however, the term \"dumbwaiter\" is still used rather than \"lazy Susan\". The reason for the naming of it is still a mystery. One theory is that it was named after either Jefferson's or Edison's daughter, both of whom were named Susan.","question":"What is a \"lazy Susan\"?","options":["A waitress","A convenient tool","A table","A cabinet"],"answer":"B"," question_type":"Detail reasoning"}
{"example_id":"high14516.txt","question_id":1,"article":"Different kinds of soil conservation methods are used by farmers to protect their land from damage by farming and the forces of nature. One important form of soil conservation is the use of windbreaks.\nWindbreaks are barriers   formed by trees and other plants with many leaves. Farmers plant them in lines around their fields. Windbreaks stop the wind from blowing soil away. They also keep the wind from destroying or damaging crops. They are very important for growing grains, such as wheat.\nThere have been studies done on windbreaks in parts of West Africa, for example. They found that grain harvests can be twenty percent higher in fields protected by windbreaks compared to fields without such protection.\nHowever, windbreaks seem to work best when they allow a little wind to pass through. If the wall of trees and plants stops wind completely, then violent air motions will take place close to the ground. These motions will lift soil into the air where it will be blown away. For this reason, a windbreak is best if it has only sixty to eighty percent of the trees and plants needed to make a solid line.\nThere should be at least two lines in each windbreak. One line should be large trees. The second line, right next to it, can be shorter trees and other plants with leaves. Locally grown trees and plants are best for windbreaks.","question":"What is a windbreak according to the passage?","options":["A windbreak is a concrete wall to prevent the strong winds.","A windbreak is a wood with different kinds of trees.","A windbreak is a wall of trees to hold soil in place.","A windbreak is a wall of wind to fight wind from the opposite way."],"answer":"C"," question_type":"Detail reasoning"}

Today dozens of firms in the area supply many of the world's approximately 13,000 RO plants in places from the Persian Gulf and Israel to Australia and China.\nSouthern California itself, however, has not so far been a big user of its own technology. This is surprising, given that the whole American south-west faces a water problem. But now as the climate gets warmer and the population increases, there is more agreement that the existing infrastructure, consisting of vast pipes that carry water from the Sacramento Delta in the north and the Colorado River in the east, will not be enough. In places such as San Diego, which has inadequate and salty groundwater and currently imports 90% or its water, the answers must be greater conservation, reusing as much water as possible, and getting most of the rest from the sea.\nThe first part, conservation, has been widely accepted by the public. San Diego today uses less water with a larger population than it did in 1989, the year water consumption peaked. The second part, water recycling has been a hard sell, because of an unpleasant factor.

These satellite-based systems provide turn-by-turn directions to help people get to where they want to go. But, they can also cause a lot of problems, send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost. Many times, the driver is to blame. Sometimes a GPS error is responsible. Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two.\nWe spoke to Mr. Brown by Skype. He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. Barry Brown: \"And they just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in. So again, the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\"\nMister Brown says this is a common human error. But, he says, what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings, or failures, of GPS equipment. Barry Brown: \"One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn. Because they just give you the next turn, sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the overview that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place.\"\nBarry Brown formerly served as a professor with the University of California, San Diego. While there, he worked on a project with Eric Laurier from the University of Edinburgh. The two men studied the effects of GPS devices on driving by placing cameras in people's cars. They wrote a paper based on their research. It is called \"The Normal, Natural Troubles of Driving with GPS.\" It lists several areas where GPS systems can cause confusion for drivers. These include maps that are outdated, incorrect or difficult to understand. They also include timing issues related to when GPS commands are given.\nBarry Brown says to make GPS systems better we need a better understanding of how drivers, passengers and GPS systems work together.","question":"What is Mr. Brown's attitude towards GPS?","options":["Unconcerned","Prejudiced","Objective","Critical"],"answer":"C"," question_type":"Attitude analysis"}

The orchestra started to play and the lights became dark as the show began.\nI loved the entire performance. Everything and everyone on stage seemed like they had just jumped off the pages of the beloved story.\nIt turns out that the Broadway experts agree with me.

Laura Osnes, who plays the role of Cinderella, has been nominated for the Tony for best actress in a musical.\nHow similar is the show to the story of Cinderella you know? The answer, of course, depends on which version of the story you've seen or read. In an interview with TIME FOR Kids, Osnes pointed out that many people are familiar with the Disney movie version. There are some differences between that movie and the Broadway show. For one thing, the stepmother and the sisters are not as cruel in the show as in the movie. Also, in the Broadway version, when Cinderella escapes from the dancing party, she picks up her shoe after dropping it. So how does the prince find Cinderella again?

But here's the problem: I'm cheap, and the iPad's not. If I'm going to fork over at least $499 for a new device, I want to try it out and make sure it's not just a larger, shinier version of my iPhone. But if I went to my local Apple Store, I'd get to spend only a few minutes testing out the machine. I wanted more time than that, so I rented one for $15 a day from a guy on SnapGoods.\nThe Internet start-up in Brooklyn runs on simple reasoning: there are people who want to borrow stuff - camping equipment, food processors, robot vacuums, etc. - and there are people who have stuff they want to lend. SnapGoods helps these two groups connect over the Web. SnapGoods is one of many sites that have sprung up to facilitate offline sharing. Some sites have a narrow, obvious focus (like SwapBabyGoods.com) while others are more obscure (Neighborhood Fruit helps people share what's growing in their yards or find fruit trees on public land). But regardless of whether the sharing is free or involves a fee, these transactions often come with a stick-it-to-the-man attitude. \"Borrow these things from your neighbors,\" reads one earnest request on neighborrow.com, \"The owner-ship has SAILED!\"\nAll of these sites are encouraging something academics call collaborative consumption - in other words, peer-to-peer sharing or renting. Renting something you don't need to use very often makes a lot more sense than buying it and letting it collect dust in your garage. There's a green aspect as well, since sharing helps cut down on overall use of resources. But one of collaborative consumption's most surprising benefits turns out to be social. In an era when families are scattered around the country and we may not know the people down the street from us, sharing things - even with strangers we've just met online - allows us to make meaningful connections.\n\"This isn't just about saving the environment or saving a dollar,\" says SnapGoods CEO Ron Williams, who came up with the idea after renting a stranger's motorcycle via Craigslist. \"This is about saving yourself by making informed consumer decisions.\"\nI'm not sure if I got a thrill when I borrowed Goodwin's iPad, but it did feel good to make a connection.

{"example_id":"high6644.txt","question_id":4,"article":"\"I will never marry,\" the future Elizabeth I declared at the age of eight, and, to the terror of her people, the Great Queen kept her word.\nFor four centuries, historians have guessed why Elizabeth never married.In her own day, her decision to remain single was considered absurd and dangerous.A queen needed a husband to make political decisions for her and to organise and lead her military campaigns.More important, she needed male heirs to avoid a civil war after her death.\nThere was no shortage of suitors for the Queen, both English courtiers   and foreign princes, and it was confidently expected for the best part of 30 years that Elizabeth would eventually marry one of them.Indeed, although she insisted that she preferred the single state, she kept these suitors in a state of permanent expectation.This was a deliberate policy on the Queen's part, since by keeping foreign princes in hope, sometimes for a decade, she kept them friendly when they might otherwise have made war on her kingdom.\nThere were, indeed, good political reasons for her avoiding marriage.The disastrous union of her sister Mary I to Philip II of Spain had had an unwelcome foreign influence upon English politics.The English were generally prejudiced against the Queen taking a foreign husband, particularly a Catholic one.Yet if she married an English, jealousy might lead to the separation of the court.\nThere were other, deeper reasons for Elizabeth's unwillingness to marry, chief of which, I believe, was her fear of losing her autonomy as Queen. In the 16th century, a queen was regarded as holding supreme dominion over the state, while a husband was thought to hold supreme dominion over his wife.Elizabeth knew that marriage and motherhood would bring some harm to her power.\nShe once pointed out that marriage seemed too uncertain a state for her. She had seen several unions in her immediate family break down, including that of her own parents.\nSome writers, based on very fragile evidence, have argued that Elizabeth was frightened or incapable of the sex act, but it is more likely that she feared childbirth. Two of her stepmothers, her grandmother and several acquaintances had died in childbed.\nElizabeth's father, Henry VIII, had had her mother, Anne Boleyn, killed; her stepmother Catherine Howard later suffered the same fate. When Elizabeth was 14 she was all but attracted by Admiral Thomas Seymour, who also went to the prison within a year. Witnessing these terrible events at an early age, it has been argued, may have put Elizabeth off marriage.\nElizabeth had to decide her priorities. Marriage or being single? Elizabeth was far too intelligent.The choice she made was courageous and revolutionary, and, in the long run, the right one for England.","question":"What is the attitude of the author towards Queen Elizabeth never marrying in her life?","options":["Pitiful.","Approving.","Negative.","Neutral."],"answer":"B"," question_type":"Attitude analysis"}

If you're complaining of stress, anxiety, depression, aches and pains, foggy thinking, or just a general lack of energy, a new medical theory will blow your mind. The chances are that those disease-like symptoms are all the result of what's called hidden food allergies .\nThis is what Ken Drew found out when he was lucky enough to be recommended to medical practitioner Dr. Patel. Patel is considered something of a genius, and has been called a modern day Louis Pasteur. You've heard of him, of course--Pasteur figured out how to keep milk from getting spoiled. Dr. Patel is like a Louis Pasteur for keeping your body from getting spoiled from chronic  diseases.\n\"Foggy thinking, slightly constipated , heart pain,...you name it. It's part of getting old,\" you say. \"It's just stress.\" Most of the body's immune defenses are all located in your stomach, so when you have a hidden food allergy and you expose yourself to harmful foods, your defenses malfunction  and disease-carrying bacteria take over. Had you not eaten that one food you were allergic to for breakfast, you would never have got sick.\nTogether, Dr Patel and Ken Drew have developed the Reverse My Disease program, which claims it can _ your body against diseases like arthritis , Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease and cancers. You won't need a prescription and there isn't any kind of medical procedure involved. There's no medical jargon, no complicated diet to do. What it does do is claim to tell you how to hack your body's natural defense system.\nDr. Patel has remained under the radar of the entire medical establishment because his ideas are so threatening to doctors who don't want you to stop being sick enough for them to write you prescriptions.

I am far from being a fan of junk food,over-salty,or over-sweet stuff,and honestly this food doesn't appeal to me at all. Maybe it is related to the fact that I grew up in Russia and at that time we were not so exposed to the foreign, especially made in America foods. We knew Coca Cola,Pepsi,juice powder and Cheetos,but this stuff was not so cheap or available to buy it every day and we couldn't buy them in large quantities. We didn't know the word\"fat\"was not a bad thing but a normal of life for some people. We always had sweets and especially on holidays they were served as a dessert along with a cake. Russians like eating sweets when they drink tea. Even with my passion to desserts I still can'trelate myself to the people Michale Moss was writing about, those consumers who could not say\"no\" when it came to junk food.\nWhat I found interesting in the book was that the author didn't focus on diets, necessity to\nexercise,sleep well at night and all other things we all are pretty aware of. The aim was not to teach people how to live but instead,after having made a huge research,interviewed more than 100 people in the food industry,Moss reveals the ugly of the food business. It puts all the facts in front of us and offers a choice:to buy or not to buy. However,the answer was known at the very beginning. Moss mentions the well-known food like Coca,Cola,Pepsi,Nestle and some others and tells how skillfully the consumers can be cheated when it comes to choosing what to put in the food basket in the supermarket. We like this taste of a chocolate,the crispy chips,and sweet porridges because it was all put on test by groups of scientists who made experiments to reveal what kind of taste will be most appealing to us. It involves brain,of course. Apart from scientific researches, it was also due to successful marketing strategies and plans that people prefer to buy food.\nIn this companies'money race,the most vulnerable victims are kids. They can't tell good from bad and love everything that makes them feel good. Commercial ads of fast food particularly targeted kids and played on the fact that mothers can't fully control what their children eat because they spent all day at work. Mothers themselves buy chocolates bars and com flakes for their kids,guided by a powerful brainwashing that actually,these products were not unhealthy, on the contrary, it was encouraged to give them to kids, because fat and sugar provide energy, so they are good,right?\nGiving a credit to some food companies, they made attempts to fight the trend, but consumers,who already worked a habit of eating too salty, too fatting and too sweet products,didn't react to the changes. So the companies returned to the old policy. Surprisingly,such behavior was strongly backed up by the govermment.\nI would definitely recommend? reading this book not only to those who struggle in the battle with his addiction to fast food but also people living healthily.

They provided the first solid evidence that lionfish were in the Atlantic. \nA year later, scientists documented 19 lionfish sightings at eight locations along the North Carolina continental shelf. Then, lionfish were observed off the coasts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, and even as far north as Long Island, New York!

During a summer 2004 research expedition, NOAA(The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) scientists collected 155 lionfish at 19 different locations off the North Carolina coast alone.

No matter how hard the Internet tries to put you in communication, its best efforts will be defeated by your mind.\nThe problem is twofold . First, there is a limit on the number of people we can hold in mind and have a meaningful relationship with. That number is about 150 and is set by the size of our brain. Second, the quality of your relationships depends on the amount of time you invest in then. We invest a lot in a small number of people and then distribute what's left among as many others as we can. The problem is that if we invest little time in a person, our _ with that person will decline until eventually it dies into \"someone I once knew\".\nThis is not, of course, to say that the Internet doesn't serve a socially valuable function. Of course it does. But the question is not that it allows you to increase the size of your social circle to include the rest of the world, but that you can keep your relationships with your existing friends going even though you have to move to the other side of the world.\nIn one sense, that's a good thing. But it also has a disadvantage. If you continue to invest in your old friends even though you can no longer see them, then certainly you aren't using your time to make new friends where you now live.

Sadly, biological facts prevent us ever realizing this dream without artificial aid--we simply weigh too much, and all our weight pushes down through our relatively small feet, resulting in a lot of pressure that makes us sink.\nHowever, several types of animals can walk on water. One of the most interesting is the common basilisk Basilicus basilicus, a lizard   native to Central and South America. It can run across water for a distance of several meters, avoiding getting wet by rapidly hitting the water's surface with its feet.

For humans, we would need huge feet that we could bring up to our ears in order to create enough \"hitting\".\nBut fortunately there is an alternative: cornflour . By adding enough of this common thickening agent to water (and it does take a lot), you can create a special mixture that doesn't behave like normal water. Now, if the surface of the water is hit hard enough, particles  in the water get together for a moment to make the surface hard. Move quickly enough and put enough force into each step, and you really can walk across the surface of this adequately thick liquid of cornflour.\nFun though all this may sound, it's still rather messy and better read about in theory than carried out in practice.

British soap operas are very different to US TV dramas. For one, they are normally longer running. The two most popular, Coronation Street and East-enders, have been running for 48 and 24 years respectively. Both are broadcast several times a week, so remarkably there have been more than 7,000 _ of Coronation Street.\nThe most obvious difference is that, unlike US dramas, the British soap operas focus on the real world. There is little glamour  , the stars are rarely rich, and they normally have boring jobs. Perhaps the appeal is that the lives of the characters often mirror the lives of the audience--but with some drama added. This means the viewer can relate to the characters and feel the pain and happiness they go through on the show.\nBecause these soap operas last for decades, the cast is ever changing. The shows rarely focus on one or two main characters. Like the real world, people come and go all the time. However, there are exceptions. Coronation Street's William Roach, 76, has played the role of Ken Barlow since the very first episode of the show in 1960, and he is still a regular.\nThe choice of which soap opera you follow is often cultural: People from the north of British tend to watch Coronation Street as it is set in Manchester.

{"example_id":"high1027.txt","question_id":1,"article":"Did you know that women's brains are smaller than men's? The average women's brain weighs 10% less than men's. Since research has shown that the bigger the brain, the cleverer the animal, men must be more intelligent than women. Right? Wrong. Men and women always score similarly on intelligence tests, despite the difference in brain size. Why? After years of study, researchers have concluded that it's what's inside that matters, not just the size of the brain. The brain consists of \"grey matter\" and  \"white matter\". While men have more of the latter, the amount of \"thinking\" brain is almost exactly the same in both sexes.\nIt has been suggested that smaller brain appears to work faster, perhaps because the two sides of the brain are better connected in women. This means that little girls tend to learn to speak earlier, and that women can understand sorts of information from different sources at the same time. When it comes to talking to the boss on the phone, cooking dinner and keeping an eye on the baby all at the same time, it's women who come out on top every time.\nThere are other important differences between two sexes. As white matter is the key to spatial   tasks, men know better where things are in relation to other things. \"A great footballer always knows where he is in relation to the other players, and he knows where to go,\" says one researcher. That may explain one of life's great mysteries: Why men refuse to ask for directions ... and women often need to!\nThe differences begin when fetuses   are about nine weeks old, which can be seen in the action of children as young as one. A boy would try to climb a barrier before him or push it down while a girl would attract help from others. These brain differences also explain the fact that more men take up jobs that require good spatial skills, while more women speech skills. It may all go back to our ancestors, among whom women needed speech skills to take care of their babies and men needed spatial skills to hunt, according to one research.\nIf all this disappoints you, it shouldn't. \"The brain changes throughout our lives according to what we do with it,\" says a biologist.","question":"What is the writer's attitude in writing this passage?","options":["Defensive.","Persuasive.","Supportive.","Objective."],"answer":"D"," question_type":"Attitude analysis"}

Why can't a human do the same?\" asked Peruvian-born surgeon Dr. Anthony Atala in a recent interview. The question, a reference to work aiming to grow new limbs for wounded soldiers, captures the inventive spirit of regenerative medicine. This innovative field seeks to provide patients with replacement body parts.\nThese parts are not made of steel; they are the real things --- living cells, tissue, and even organs.\nRegenerative medicine is still mostly experimental, with clinical applications limited to procedures such as growing sheets of skin on burns and wounds. One of its most significant advances took place in 1999,when a research group at North Carolina's Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine conducted a successful organ replacement with a laboratory-grown bladder. Since then, the team, led by Dr. Atala, has continued to generate a variety of other tissues and organs  from kidneys to ears.\nThe field of regenerative medicine builds on work conducted in the early twentieth century with the first successful transplants of donated human soft tissue and bone. However, donor organs are not always the best option. First of all, they are in short supply, and many people die while waiting for an available organ; in the United States alone, more than 100,000 people are waiting for organ transplants. Secondly, a patient's body may ultimately reject the transplanted donor organ. An advantage of regenerative medicine is that the tissues are grown from a patient's own cells and will not be rejected by the body's immune system.\nToday, several labs are working to create bioartificial body parts. Scientists at Columbia and Yale Universities have grown a jawbone and a lung. At the University of Minnesota, Doris Taylor has created a beating bioartificial rat heart. Dr. Atala's medical team has reported long-term success with bioengineered bladders implanted into young patients with spina bifida (a birth defect that involves the incomplete development of the spinal cord). And at the University of Michigan, H. David Humes has created an artificial kidney.\nSo far, the kidney procedure has only been used successfully with sheep, but there is hope that one day similar kidney will be implantable in a human patient.

They join the countless species that have gone extinct   over the course of Earth's history - and extinction means forever. At least it used to. Scientists are now closing in on the ability to bring back extinct species. No, this doesn't mean the plot of Jurassic Park is going to become a reality. Researchers need DNA to bring back a species. DNA is the chemical that carries the structure for a living thing. Dinosaurs have been gone too long for any of their DNA to remain in fossils.\nBut there's a very real chance that we will be able to bring back more recently extinct species. This could even include Ice Age animals like the woolly mammoth. In 2003, a team of Spanish and French scientists re-created the Pyrenean ibex, which had gone extinct three years earlier. The new animal didn't survive long, but scientific advances should improve the success rate. In January, Australian scientists announced that they were on their way to bringing back the gastric brooding frog.\nThat we can bring species back doesn't mean that we should. There may be benefits to reviving a species. But there's no way to know how it will turn out. For example, would a passenger pigeon fit into its old habitat? Or might it crowd out existing species?\nEnvironmentalists worry that our ability to bring species back might cut down support for the hard work of traditional conservation.

To be well disciplined is to have learned to live in accordance with the sensible rules and regulations that society has set up for the behavior of its members.\nUnless the child learns from each disciplinary situation how better to govern his conduct, effective discipline has not been developed. Parents must accept for themselves the idea that successful discipline results in learning. When they approach situations in which a child must adapt themselves to demands made upon them as learning situations, many problems usually thought of in connection with discipline disappear.\nUnfortunately, the word discipline has come to have other less constructive meanings. Far too often discipline is thought of as punishment. To many people, to discipline a child means to spank him or use some other method of punishment. Such people consider discipline a way of either keeping a child from doing something or of forcing him to do something.\nIt is the task of parents to build within themselves and within the children with whom they live this capacity for self-direction, based upon an understanding of what is required of individuals in a democratic society. This means learning to act in those ways known to be necessary for the \"good life\", not for one's self alone but also for others.\nDeveloping the capacity for self-discipline in a child is a long, slow process. Much patience is required on the part of the parents. During this development, it is important that the child's self- confidence and comfortable acceptance of himself should never be sacrificed in a disciplinary battle; instead it should be increased through the ways in which his parents meet disciplinary situations. Many parents show a good deal of impatience if the little child does not rapidly learn how to keep clean, eat well, be orderly, and do what he is told. They are so eager for him to achieve these things that they seem to try to push him rapidly through his baby period. They seem also to think that learning to do these things at the earliest possible age will place the child one jump ahead in the competitive race foe success.

All you have to do is send a few comets in the direction of Earth, and its orbit will be changed. Our world will then be sent spinning into a safer, colder part of the solar system.\nThis idea for improving our climate comes from a group of US National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) engineers and American astronomers. They say their plan could add another six billion years to the useful lifetime of our planet--effectively doubling its working life.\nThe plan put forward by Dr Laughlin, and his colleagues Don Korycansky and Fred Adams is designed to carefully direct a comet or asteroid  so that it passes close by our planet and sends some of its gravitational energy to Earth.\n\"Earth's orbital speed would increase as a result and we would move to a higher orbit away from the Sun,\" Laughlin said.\nEngineers would then direct their comet so that it passed close to Jupiter or Saturn. The comet would pick up energy from one of these giant planets.

Every weekday morning since then, she has left her home to meet nine other old people in a church for a rich program of charity work, trips, games, and -- most important of all -- friendly companionship.  \nJust a few years ago, there were few choices for the elderly between a normal life in their own homes and being totally confined in nursing homes. Many of them were sent to rest homes long before they needed full-time care. Others like Mrs. Jones were left to take care of themselves. But in 1971, the White House Conference on Aging called for the development of alternatives to care in nursing homes for old people, and since then, government-supported day-care programs like The Brighter Side have been developed in most big American cities.  \n\"This represents a real alternative to the feared institution and makes old people believe they have not left the world of living\", says Alice Brophy, 64, director of New York City's Office for the Aging, \"They do well at the centers, and I hate it when people describe us as elderly playpens .\" New York's 138 centers encourage continuing contact for the aged with the community's life. The centers serve more than 15,000 members, and volunteer workers are always looking for new ones. If someone doesn't show up at the center for several days in a row, a worker at the center calls to make sure all is well. And although participation in the center is free, those who want to can pay for their lunches.  \nNo normal studies have been made of these centers for the elderly, but government officials are enthusiastic. In the future, the Public Health Service will do a study to decide if the programs can receive federal Medicare money.

However, now they are becoming an extended period of adolescence, during which many of today's students and are not shouldered with adult responsibilities.\nFor previous generations, college was decisive break from parental control; guidance and support needed help from people of the same age and from within. In the past two decades, however, continued connection with and dependence on family, thanks to cellphones, email and social media, have increased significantly. Some parents go so far as to help with coursework. Instead of promoting the idea of college as a _ from the shelter of the family to autonomy and adult responsibility, universities have given in to the idea that they should provide the same environment as that of the home.\nTo prepare for increased autonomy and responsibility, college needs to be a time of exploration and experimentation. This process involves \"trying on \" new ways of thinking about oneself both intellectually? and personally. While we should provide \"safe spaces\" within colleges, we must also make it safe to express opinions and challenge majority views. Intellectual growth and flexibility are fostered on debate and questioning.\nLearning to deal with the social world is equally important. Because a college community? differs from the family, many students will struggle to find a sense of belonging. If students rely on administrators to regulate their social behavior and thinking pattern, they are not facing the challenge of finding an identity within a larger and complex community.\nMoreover, the tendency for universities to monitor and shape student behavior runs up against another characteristic of young adults: the response to being controlled by their elders. If acceptable social behavior is too strictly defined? and controlled, the insensitive or aggressive behavior that administrators are seeking to minimize may actually be encouraged.\nIt is not surprising that young people are likely to burst out, particularly when there are reasons to do so. Our generation once joined hands and stood firm at times of national emergency. What is lacking today is the conflict between adolescent's desire for autonomy and their understanding of an unsafe world. Therefore, there is the desire for their dorms to be replacement homes and not places to experience intellectual growth.\nEvery college discussion about community values, social climate and behavior should include recognition of the developmental importance of student autonomy and self-regulation, of the necessary tension between safety and self-discovery.","question":"What's the author's attitude toward continued parental guidance to college students?","options":["Sympathetic","Disapproving","Supportive","Neutral"],"answer":"B"," question_type":"Attitude analysis"}

In the future, there will be a lot more opportunities to travel to faraway places than now... perhaps even as far as the moon. As people adventure further and further away and as planes, trains, cars, and rocket ships become faster, is it safer to have these vehicles controlled by humans or by computers?\nWhile many flights by plane are controlled automatically by machines, most people today wouldn't let their car drive itself. That's because currently the autopilot function on your car can only keep it on the same course you are travelling on. It won't turn the car right or left. It won't stop if an animal jumps in the way. However, cars today can sense when something is too close and warn the driver with flashing lights and alarms. Many cars also have GPS(global positioning systems) that tell drivers which road to take and when to turn. These systems, unlike human drivers, never get lost. In the future, it is easy to believe that your car will be better able to drive itself with the aid of computers that can determine the position of your car and the speed it should travel at.\nIn addition to computers being 'smarter' than people regarding the best way to go or knowing how close another vehicle is, computers don't get sick, tired, or angry. This means they won't make the same mistakes that people make when they are not having a good day. While responding with emotion is a good thing when choosing the best way to deal with a friend's personal problem, it may not be such a good thing when deciding what to do at the wheel of a fast-moving vehicle.\nSo what are the disadvantages of autopilot systems? Maybe one disadvantage is that a small computer problem could cause a serious accident. It could also be argued that in unexpected situations, computers might not be able to respond appropriately; some decisions require human emotions.

{"example_id":"high10585.txt","question_id":1,"article":"In the past years a lot of people migrated from one country to another in Europe. They had to leave their countries with their traditions, their cultures and sometimes also their families. People migrate because they think that they will have a better life, they will find a job and they will make a lot of money for their families to survive. Sometimes it's true, and they find a job, they make a lot of money and then they go back to their families to help them. But sometimes they are not that lucky.\nThe problem that those people create is that a lot of people from Europe are unemployed and they don't have jobs because immigrants have taken so many jobs. But the question is also: Would European people want a job such as cleaning or hard labor? I think that most of them wouldn't. So we should stop criticizing for a moment and think. We would then maybe realize that it's not that bad to have immigrants at home.\nThe only problem is that it's not right that immigrants want to impose(  )their religion on other countries by leading and building mosques ( ). Because if they had done that in other countries they would have caused trouble. Phenomena like these happened a few years ago in Great Britain: It was forbidden to switch on Christmas lights outside, because Christmas is a Catholic (  ) recurrence and it was offensive for the Islamic people who lived there. That is not right. The country that gives hospitality to immigrants has the task to allow them to enter society, to be free to believe in their religion and their culture, but every country does not have to forget its tradition and culture.

{"example_id":"high16692.txt","question_id":2,"article":"The gray wolf used to live in most of the northern United States, including Colorado. In fairy tales, wolves can be pretty mean, but in real life, wolves are shy animals that are afraid of people. They are predators of deer, elk  and antelope. But as more people settled in the country, they killed off many of them, so wolves started eating the cattle and sheep that the settlers brought with them. Because the settlers needed those cattle and sheep for their own families, and because many people are afraid of wolves, people started killing wolves until they became endangered. Many places would even offer money to anyone who would kill a wolf. The last wolf in Colorado was shot 50 years ago.\nNow, the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife would like to see wolves reintroduced into their natural homes. This is happening already in Minnesota, but not in Colorado yet. There are lots of deer and elk in the Colorado mountains for them to eat now. In fact, many people feel that having the wolves back would be a help to the deer and elk herds . Without enough natural enemies, the herds get too big. Also, wolves and other predators usually catch the oldest or the sickest deer, so maybe they could help keep the other deer from getting sick and dying, too. But for ranchers , will the wolves come after cattle if there are plenty of deer to eat? It's hard to know. In Minnesota, they offer ranchers money to pay for animals that are known to have been killed by wolves.

{"example_id":"high1937.txt","question_id":1,"article":"Uncertainty spreads through our lives so thoroughly that it dominates our language. Our everyday speech is made up in large part of words like probably, many, soon, great, little. What do these words mean?Such verbal expression is not necessarily to be criticized. Indeed, it has a value just because it allows us to express judgments when a precise quantitative statement is out of the question.\nWe have been trying to pin down by experiments what people mean by these expressions in specific contexts, and how the meanings change with age. For instance, a subject is told \"There are many trees in the park\" and is asked to say what number the word many mean to him. Or a child is invited to take \"some\" sweets from a bowl and we then count how many he has taken. We compare the number he takes when he is alone with the number when one or more other children are present and are to take some sweets after him, or with the number he takes when told to give \"some\" sweets to another child.\nFirst, we find that the number depends, of course, on the items involved. To most people some friends means about five, while some trees means about twenty. However, unrelated areas sometimes show parallel values. For instance, the language of probability seems to mean about the same thing in predictions about the weather and about politics: the expression \"is certain to\" (rain, or be elected) signifies to the average person about a 70 percent chance; \"is likely to\", about a 60 percent chance; \"probably will\" about 55 percent.\nSecondly, the size of the population of items influences the value assigned to an expression. Thus, if we tell a subject to take \"a few\" or \" a lot of\" glass balls from a box, he will take more if the box contains a large number of glass balls than if it has a small number. But not proportionately more: if we increase the number of glass balls eight times, the subject takes only half as large a percentage of the total.\nThirdly, there is a marked change with age. Among children between six and fourteen years old, the older the child, the fewer glass balls he will take. But the difference between a lot and a few widens with age. This age effect is so consistent that it might be used as a test of intelligence.","question":"What's the right attitude towards the words like probably, many, soon?","options":["They are inaccurate and we should avoid them.","They are necessary since we cannot be always precise.","They should be criticized because there are too many of them.","Their value is not yet clear since we don't know their meaning."],"answer":"B"," question_type":"Attitude analysis"}

It can review the weather report and suggest that you grab an umbrella. This purse can even upload your favorite songs onto your scarf.\nSure, a computing purse and scarf set may seem like the stuff of science fiction.

Or do you think of something that ships can crash into? While these are both correct, in truth there's far more to icebergs than meets the eye.\nAccording to scientists, only the largest blocks of ice count as icebergs. They must rise at least 5 meters above the water and be 15 meters wide at the water line. But only about 10 percent of an iceberg can be seen. The rest lie beneath the water.\nIcebergs begin froming when layers of snow fall year after year without melting. The snow is pressed together into large blocks of ice called glaciers. When chunks of ice break off these glaciers, icebergs are born. In Greenland alone, about 40,000 icebergs are formed each year.\nSince they began as snow, icebergs are made of fresh water, not salty ocean water. Tidy bubbles of air inside the ice give them their white color1.\nWhile most icebergs are white, some are blue because they have melted and frozen again. This action allows the air bubbles to escape. Other icebergs have brown, black or yellow parts because of dirt mixed with the ice. Algae   can also get trapped in the underwater parts of an iceberg. If the iceberg turns over, all or part of it is green!\nIcebergs can be flat, cube-shaped, round like a turtle shell or U-shaped. Some even look like mountains.\nThe large underwater parts of icebergs are hard for ships to avoid. They have destroyed and sunk many ships, including the Titanic. As a result, the International Ice Patrol now monitors icebergs in areas with heavy ship traffic.\nBut there's yet another side to icebergs.

But while Chinese universities have the tradition of spring outings, what's the benefit of making spring break an institution?\nQin Jianguo, of the student affairs office at Shenzhen University, thinks the idea of the spring break in some universities in China comes from the intention of pushing students out of the ivory tower to experience more diversity in their lives.\n\"Take traveling for example. A week traveling is a very different experience to a one- or two-day outing,\" said Qin. \"Students are expected to acquire the spirit of teamwork and compromise, and learn survival and communication skills when put out there in an unfamiliar context.\"\nDiverse approaches\nMany countries have similar vacations in the middle of the semester for students to do things out of their own interest. Taking Japan as an example, instead of partying like their US counterparts, many Japanese students choose to work as interns or engage in study-related projects.\n\"The spring break is an opportunity for many of our students to put their learning to use,\" said Hiroshi Kanno, dean of the Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy at Hitotsubashi University, in the school's description of a recent spring break project.\nAs for Chinese students who take a week off around the Labor Day holiday, many tend to do volunteer work. Duan Zhipeng, a 22-year-old economics major at Renmin University, applied for a project to go back to his hometown in Jiangxi province to introduce his university's enrollment policies and campus culture to local high school students.\nNot a trend yet\nApart from Renmin University, only a few other universities, such as Yantai University, have a spring break for their students. The concept in China is still far from the culture and norms built around it in the US.\nWei Xiang, a professor specializing in holiday economics at Beijing International Studies University, said that the spring break is a good experiment for universities to make study schedules smoother in order to give students more options to arrange their own leisure and study activities.","question":"Which of the following is Not true according to the passage?","options":["Spring break can help students to gain new experiences beyond the campus walls.","Students are expected to acquire the spirit of teamwork through pring break.","Spring break can help students tolearn survival and communication skills when in an unfamiliar context.","Spring break is not common in the US."],"answer":"D"," question_type":"Whole-picture reasoning"}

Similar to Pimsleur, SuperMemo is engineered according to a carefully researched methodology   in order to test you on a card the very minimum number of times you need to see it for it to stick. When you look at a card, you give some feedback to the software on whether you got it right and how easy you found it. It uses this information, and that of your previous attempts, to decide when you will be shown the card next. It's smart and it really works.\nIf you're like me, the news is even better! I have a version of SuperMemo that runs on my PalmOS phone. Wherever I am, if I have my phone handy, I have thousands of flashcards with me too. Honestly, it would be worth purchasing a cheap Palm device only for this. You can pick one up for $20 or even less on eBay or elsewhere.

As a result, when I first married, we only had one car and car pooled to work. My husband's hours were different from mine by one hour. I worked earlier. So he dropped me off and went to the diner to drink coffee until work time.\nThen, in the afternoons, I leisurely walked the three miles to his work place where I waited in his car, reading a book.\nOne day while waiting for him, I noticed the most beautiful Cadillac pull in the lot. It was powder blue and sleek looking. The kind of car you dream about. I was busily admiring the car, when I noticed the driver. Honestly, she was probably the prettiest woman I had ever seen off the movie screen.\nShe pulled into the spot beside our car and it was all I could do not to stare. There was a striking resemblance to Liz Taylor. Jet black hair and alabaster skin. Our eyes made contact and she smiled at me. Her eyes were as blue as the sea, and teeth like an even row of pearls. She was wearing a light blue shirt that just matched her car. Peeking through her long, softly curled hair I could see gold hoop earrings. They had to be gold to shine like that. A couple of minutes later, a nice looking man came out of the building, entered her car, leaned over and kissed her and she drove away.\nSitting there in my jeans, shirt and hair in a pony tail, I wanted to cry. How could some people have it all?\nMaybe I would have forgotten about her, but the following week, I saw her again. Then it became almost routine to see her about once a week. She seemed friendly and always waved, flashing a big smile. My envy lingered long after she drove away.\nMany nights when sleep evaded me, I would think about the beautiful lady. I wondered if she and her husband ate out, and where they dined, and what she was wearing. I wanted her to get out of the car and let me see her full length. Did she wear really high heeled shoes and pants, or a skirt.\nI would get my answers in a couple of weeks.\nSitting in our usual parking lot, I was holding my book, watching her over the top of it. She was waiting and when her husband came to the car, she called to him. They spoke a few words and he opened the car door for her to step out. He took her arm and helped her out of the car. I could see very well as she moved to get out. She was wearing a skirt.\nShe _ walked around to the passenger side very slowly, leaning on a walking cane. Sitting sideways in the car, she lifted one leg with her hands and then the other one. The beautiful lady had a prosthesis on the left leg and a brace on the right leg. I couldn't watch them drive away as the tears were blinding me. For weeks I had envied this woman and her way of life, while I had been able to walk three miles to our car!\nWhen my husband arrived and found me crying, he immediately asked what was wrong. Through my tears, I told him about the beautiful lady. He said he knew her husband and also knew the story. The beautiful lady and her parents were in a car that either stalled or got caught on the railroad tracks and was hit by a train. Both parents were killed and she was severely injured. She was only 12 years old. The railroad made a large settlement with her because the crossing had no signals. He explained her car was specially built for her needs as well as the home.\nI prayed for forgiveness all the way home. The lady I thought had everything I didn't. I realized how lucky I was to have my parents, the ability to walk, run or dance through life and many wonderful things money can't buy.

Susan smoked for many years and is an admitted sun worshipper, whose habits Jeanne does not share. A new study of twins suggests you can blame those coarse wrinkles, brown or pink spots on too much time in the sun, smoking, and being overweight.\nBecause twins share genes, but may have different exposures to environmental factors, studying twins allows an \"opportunity to control for genetic susceptibility ,\" Dr. Elma D. Baron, at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio, and his colleagues explain in the latest issue of Archives of Dermatology.\nTheir analysis of environmental skin-damaging factors in 65 pairs of twins hints that skin aging is related more to environment and lifestyle than genetic factors.\nBut when it comes to skin cancer, the researchers say their findings support previous reports that both environment and genes affect skin cancer risk.\nBaron's team examined facial skin of 130 twins, 18 to 77 years old, who lived mostly in the northem Midwest and Eastern regions of the US, who were attending the Twins Days Festival in Ohio in August 2002. At this time, each of the twins also separately reported how their skin burned or tanned without sunscreen, their weight, and their history of skin cancer, smoking, and alcohol drinking. The study group consisted of 52 fraternal and 10 identical twin pairs, plus 3 pairs who were unsure of their twin status.\nFrom these data, the researchers noted strong ties, outside of twin status, between smoking, older age, and being overweight, and having facial skin with evidence of environmental damage. By contrast, sunscreen use and drinking alcohol appeared related to less skin damage.\nBaron and his colleagues say the current findings, which highlight ties between facial aging and potentially avoidable environmental factors--such as smoking, being overweight, and unprotected overexposure to the sun's damaging rays--may help motivate people to minimize these risky behaviors.","question":"Which of the following is true according to the passage?","options":["Jeanne and Susan share all the habits including smoking.","Skin aging is related more to environment and lifestyle than genetic factors.","Only identical twins can take part in the research.","Sunscreen use cannot help people have less skin damage."],"answer":"B"," question_type":"Whole-picture reasoning"}

{"example_id":"high17694.txt","question_id":2,"article":"The term \"smog\" was first used in London during the early 1900's to describe the combination of smoke and fog.  What we typically call \" smog\"  today is a mixture of pollutants but is primarily made up of ground-level ozone   .\n     Ozone can be beneficial or harmful depending on where it stays. The ozone staying high above the Earth protects human health and the environment, but ground-level ozone is responsible for the choking, coughing, and painful eyes associated with smog. The ozone in smog also prevents plants growth and can cause widespread damage to crops and forest.\n     Major smog occurrences often are linked to heavy motor vehicle traffic, high temperatures, sunshine, and calm winds. Weather and geography affect the position and severity of smog. Because temperature regulates the length of time it takes for smog to form, smog can form faster and be more severe on a hot and sunny day. When warm air stays near the ground instead of rising and winds are calm, smog may stay trapped over your city for days. As traffic and other sources add more pollutants to the air, the smog gets worse. Smog is often more severe away from the pollution sources because the chemical reactions that cause smog occur in the atmosphere while the reacting chemicals are being moved by the wind.\n    Smog is a visible example of air pollution. You can look into the distance during the day to see how much smog there is in the air. In addition, most cities measure the concentrations of pollutants in the air and report the results to the public.\n     Environmental Protection Agency sets national standards for pollutants. Areas that fail to meet the standards for at least one air pollutant are called \"nonattainment    areas. \" New measures are being taken by local governments across the country to reduce air pollution in nonattainment areas. These include: banning charcoal barbecues and wood burning in stoves or fireplaces when pollution levels are high; developing programs to encourage carpooling and voluntary \"ozone actions\" ; limiting traffic in overcrowded areas; expanding or improving public transportation systems;  requiring employers to contribute to employee public transportation costs;  assessing \" smog fees\" on cars according to the number of miles driven and vehicle emissions  produced; and even buying and breaking up older \" super-dirty\"  cars.","question":"Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?","options":["Air quality is better in time of calm wind.","Smog is more severe near pollution sources.","It takes more time for smog to form in hot weather.","Chemical reactions occur in the moving air and cause smog."],"answer":"D"," question_type":"Whole-picture reasoning"}

The crowds go wild trying to catch a brief glimpse of their smiling, color1fully dressed idols. The stars are transported in their chauffeur driven Rolls Royces, private helicopters or executive airplanes. They are surrounded by a permanent entourage   of managers, press agents and bodyguards. Photographs of them appear regularly in the press and all their comings and goings are reported, for, like royalty, pop stars are news. If they enjoy many of the privileges of royalty, they certainly share many of the inconveniences as well. It is dangerous for them to make unscheduled appearances in public. They must be constantly shielded from the adoring crowds who idolize them. They are no longer private individuals, but public property. The financial rewards they receive for this sacrifice cannot be calculated, for their rates of pay are great.\n              And why not? Society has always rewarded its top entertainers lavishly. The great days of Hollywood have become legendary: famous stars enjoyed fame, wealth and adulation   on an all time scale. By today's standards, the excesses of Hollywood do not seem quite so spectacular. A single gramophone record  nowadays may earn much more in royalties than the films of the past ever did. The competition for the title \"Top of the Pops\" is fierce, but the rewards are truly huge.\n              It is only right that the stars should be paid in this way. Don't the top men in industry earn enormous salaries for the service they perform to their companies and their countries? Pop stars earn vast sums in foreign currency -- often more than large industrial companies -- and the taxman can only be grateful for their massive annual contributions to the exchequer  . So who would envy them their rewards?\n              It's all very well for people in boring jobs to complain about the successes and rewards of others. People who make envious remarks should remember that the most famous stars represent only the tip of the iceberg. For every famous star, there are hundreds of others struggling to earn a living. A man working in a steady job and looking forward to a pension at the end of it has no right to expect very high rewards.

On suburban trains in Calcutta, for instance, just one person in the whole car will buy a newspaper and read aloud the best bits to his fellow passengers, much to everybody's enjoyment.\nThe nature of what is news may change. What essentially makes news is what affects our lives and the big political stories, the coverage of the wars, earthquakes and other disasters, will continue much the same. I think there will be more coverage of scientific research, though. It's already happening in areas that may directly affect our lives, like genetic engineering. In the future I think there will be more coverage of scientific explanations of why we feel as we do, whether it's love or depression. We develop a better understanding of how the brain operates and what our feelings really are.\nIt's quite possible that in the next century newspaper will be transmitted  electronically from thenational equivalents of Fleet Street (,) and printed out in our own homes. In fact, I'm pretty sure that that is how it will happen in future. You'll be probably selecting from a menu, making up your own _ by picking out the things you want to read and say. You might even have an intelligent screening device   to do the job for you.\nI think people have got it wrong when they talk about the competition between the different media. They actually have a relationship, feeding off each other. It was once predicted that television would kill off newspapers, which hasn't happened. What is read on the printed page is more enduring   than pictures on a flickering screen or sound lost in the sky. And as for the Internet, it's never really satisfying to read something just on a screen.","question":"Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?","options":["It was centuries ago that newspapers came into being .","Televisions have taken the place of newspapers .","The Internet will gradually take the place of newspapers.","The nature of news may remain the same over generations."],"answer":"A"," question_type":"Whole-picture reasoning"}
{"example_id":"high3559.txt","question_id":4,"article":"Dickson Despommier, a public health professor at Columbia University in New York City developed an idea with his students nine years ago. They imagined people in cities growing crops inside a tall building. Tomatoes could grow on one floor of the skyscraper , potatoes on the next, small animals and fish on the floor above.\nThis vertical  farm, or \"farmscraper\", could have space for restaurants and other places that serve food, like schools or hospitals. They could serve foods that are truly locally grown.\nBut why would anyone want to build a farm indoors in a city? Dickson Despommier believes it will become necessary. The world needs to find places to produce enough food to feed the growing population. Space, he says, is an all-important issue.\nThe professor also points to the problems of traditional farms. They use a lot of freshwater. Their fertilizer and animal waste can pollute water resources. And their growing seasons can be limited.\nBut inside the vertical farm, crops could grow all year. And there would be no wind to blow away soil. Farmers would not have to worry about too much or too little rain, or about hot summers, freezing winters or insects. And without insects there would be no need for chemicals to kill them.\nFarm machines that .use fossil fuels, like tractors, would not be needed either. And water could be recycled for drinking. \"The vertical farm reuses everything, so there is no waste,\" says Professor Despommier.\nEven buildings could be saved. Old buildings could become new farms and provide jobs.\nThe professor has been actively proposing the idea to cities as far away as Dubai and Canada. But so far it exists only in plans and drawings, and a model at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.\nCritics say building a farmscraper would cost too much, especially considering the price of land in many cities. Dickson Despommier estimates the cost at about twenty to thirty million dollars.\nBut he says the building would not have to be very tall. And his graduate students have found many empty lots and unused buildings in New York City that could provide space.","question":"Which of the following is true according to the passage?","options":["A vertical farm has been built in Chicago.","Old buildings could be changed into new farms.","Traditional farms use less water but pollute more water","There are some vertical farms being put into use in Canada."],"answer":"B"," question_type":"Whole-picture reasoning"}

She held our hands and said, \"Victor and Elizabeth, my children, I'm very happy because you love each other, and because one day you'll get married. Everyone in the family loves you, Elizabeth. Will you take my place in the family, my dear? I can die happy if you look after them when I have gone.\"\nMy mother died and we were very sad, because we loved her dearly. Elizabeth was brave and helped us; her sweet smile gave us some happiness in the unhappy days after my mother's death. The time came for me to go to university. I didn't want to leave my sad family, but we all knew that I should go. It was hard to leave, too, because the parents of my good friend Henry would not let him go to university with me. So I had gone alone.\nOn my first day at university I met my teacher, Professor Waldman, who was one of the greatest scientists in the world. He gave a wonderful talk to all the students who were starting at the university. He ended his talk by saying, \"Some of you will become the greatest scientists of tomorrow. You must study hard and discover everything that you can. This is why God made you intelligent--to help other people.\"\nAfter the professor's talk, I thought very carefully. I remembered the storm when I was 15; I remembered how the lightning had destroyed the tree. From then on, I wanted to use electricity to help people, and I wanted to discover the secrets of life. I decided to work on these two things.\nI started to work the next day. I worked very hard and soon Professor Waldman and I realized that I could learn to be a very good scientist.\nThe professor helped me very much, and other important scientists who were his friends helped me, too. I was interested in my work and I did not take one day's holiday during the next two years, I did not go home, and my letters to my family were very short.\nAfter two years, I had discovered many things and I built a scientific machine that was the best in the university. My machine would help me answer the most important question of all. How does life begin? Is it possible to put life into dead things? To answer these questions about life I had to learn first about death. I had to watch bodies from the moment when they died and the warm life left them. In the hospital and in the university, I watched the dying and the dead. Day after day, month after month, I followed death, so it was a dark and terrible time.\nI built a tall mast about 150 meters high, which is higher than the tallest building in the city, to catch lightning and send the electricity down to my machine in the lab. I believed I could use that electricity to give life to things that were dead.\nThen one day, the answer came to me. Suddenly I was sure that I knew the secret of life.","question":"Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?","options":["Elizabeth married shortly after Victor's mother died.","Elizabeth was a brave girl who loved Victor and gave him much help.","Victor's mother was very angry when she knew he loved Elizabeth.","Victor did not want to leave his family because his mother died not long before."],"answer":"B"," question_type":"Whole-picture reasoning"}

{"example_id":"high7174.txt","question_id":2,"article":"A Tale of Two Cities was written by the famous English writer Charles Dickens. The tale is mainly about the French Revolution in 1789, where the poor rose up against the king and the nobles. Dickens showed deep sympathy for the poor and deep hatred for the cruelty of the upper class, though he wrote quite a lot about the love triangle between Lucie, Charles and Sydney.\nIn this novel, Dickens wrote some lively characters like Sydney and those crazy revolutionaries. In this tale, we can't see any absolute roles. Charles, though he's a brave and good man, obviously he hasn't as much ability as Sydney. Sydney, a typical tragic  man, a man like him, usually has great ability. But he has some weak points on characters and the worst is that he always loves a woman he shouldn't love and 99.99% die for her at last in an extremely heroic or tragic way. The revolutionaries are not as full of justice as usual. They get mad when they can get revenge  for their unfair treatment. The fire of hatred burns everything. When they're at the bottom of the society, they're calling for justice, for fair treatment, for freedom, but when they're in charge of the society, their world is up-side-down. They hate everything that is connected to the very people against them, even including Charles' wife, Dr. Manette's daughter. So _ have no difference from those former governors at heart.\nThough Dickens told us how the authority is recycling over and over again in some way, the novel is about something good. Love from Sydney to Lucie is one of the only few bright points in the novel and it's really great. A man can sacrifice his life to save his lover's husband. He doesn't have any personal purpose and just for his lover's happiness.

Economists, who generally believe that supply tends to meet demand, have long thought about this question. Even in good times, i.e. not now, there are people who can't find work. And even in bad times, i.e. now, there are job openings. With over 14 million people out of work and looking for a job, you would think every available job would be filled. But that's not the case. Not now and not ever.\nOn Monday, the Nobel Prize committee awarded the prize for economics to the three scholars who have done the most to explain this phenomenon. Two of the winners are Americans, Peter Diamond of MIT and Dale Mortensen of Northwestern. The third winner is Christopher Pissarides, who teaches at the London School of Economics and was born on Cyprus.\nLike most of economics, what they have found about why the jobless and ready-employers don't find each other seems obvious.

And does the awarding of the prize contribute to the politicians' lowering joblessness?\nSpeaking from his north London home, Pissarides told The Associated Press the announcement came as \"a complete surprise\" though his work had already helped shape thinking on both sides of the Atlantic.\nFor example, the New Deal for Young People, a British government policy aimed at getting 18-24-year-olds back on the job market after long periods of unemployment, \"is very much based on our work,\" he said.\n\"One of the key things we found is that it is important to make sure that people do not stay unemployed too long so they don't lose their feel for the labor force,\" Pissarides told reporters in London. \"The ways of dealing with this need not be expensive training - it could be as simple as providing work experience.\"","question":"Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?","options":["Pissarides thinks his work surprising.","The work of Pissarides has influenced many economists.","Some of the winners' ideas have been put into practice.","It is probable that unemployed young people in Britain benefit from Pissarides' work."],"answer":"A"," question_type":"Whole-picture reasoning"}

{"example_id":"high18205.txt","question_id":1,"article":"Kayaking is an activity enjoyed by many people of all ages. It requires little or no experience and nearly anyone of any skill level can participate. It's most popular as a summertime sport, but it is also a great activity during the winter. Kayaking also seems  ly friendly to the environment; more so than speed boating or water skiing. Because a kayak doesn't create large or frequent waves, require fuel, or scatter hazards into the air, it is indeed a fairly safe activity for humans and wildlife alike.\nKayaking on freshwater lakes and streams creates little turbulence and therefore does not disturb fish or other aquatic life. Actually, the gentle paddling and movement of the kayak helps to bring seaweed to the surface, making for convenient snacking to the fish. However, there is a drawback to the all-you-can-buffet for your fishy friends. In addition to bringing food to the surface, kayaking also stirs up litter that's been hiding beneath the waters. Some aquatic animals will mistake it for food. This could cause the animals to choke on the indigestible litter, leading to death. As hazardous as this sounds, it isn't very likely for such an event to take place. Most litter in lakes and streams is found along the shoreline and settles in the sand and dirt, and isn't likely to drift away to the main body of water.\n    ^    . And because kayaks do not have a motor, fish have no risk of getting caught underneath the boat.\nOne potential hazard that results from kayaking is human waste. This depends solely on where you plan to kayak, and if there are resources available (such as campsites) along the shoreline. When there are no facilities in sight, you're paddling in the middle of a lake, and nature calls, then often you are given no choice but to expel your waste in the middle of the water. While human waste is considered biodegradable, it can be harmful when swallowed by fish. The only preventative measure is to avoid using the water as a restroom. Some public lakes and streams have taken steps to preserve the quality of the water by requiring permits for kayaking. This won't eliminate a human waste problem, but does help regulate entry into the lake and prevent it from becoming overcrowded.\nAs an important factor to remember when kayaking is that you are a guest in someone else's home. You may not be greeted by anyone or be able to kick up your feet and watch TV, but the water is home to many aquatic animals and wildlife. Just as you would not throw trash on the floor or destroy the home of another, you shouldn't do it outdoors either. Keep all trash with you in your kayak and properly dispose of it after you return to shore. By doing your part, you will help doing your part, you will help keep kayaking a safe and enjoyable activity for yourself and the environment.","question":"Which of the following statements is True about Kayaking according to the passage?","options":["Young people's enjoyment of kayaking exceeds that of other people.","Water skiing has more negative effects on the environment than Kayaking.","Usually, kayaking is only practiced in the summer.","Whether you can kayak depends on resources available along the shoreline."],"answer":"B"," question_type":"Whole-picture reasoning"}

But a new study suggests that the way you feel about your goal can change your concept of time and that some simple strategies could make you feel less rushed.\nIn a series of experiments, Jordan Etkin, a professor of marketing at Duke, and her co-authors, Loannis Evangelidis and Jennifer Aaker, looked at what happens when people see their goals as conflicting with one another. In one, they asked some participants to list two of their goals that they felt were in conflict, and others simply to list two of their goals. Those who were forced to think about conflicting aims felt more time pressure than those who weren't. In another experiment, the researchers gave participants a similar prompt regarding goal conflict, but this time measured their anxiety levels as well as their attitudes toward time. They found that participants who thought about conflicting goals had more anxiety than those who didn't, and that this, in turn, led to feelings of being short on time.\n\"Stress and anxiety and time pressure are closely linked concepts,\" D. Etkin explained. \"When we feel more stress and anxiety in relation to our personal goals, that manifests as a sense of having less time.\"\nTechnological advances that allow people to do lots of things at once may increase the fe'eling of goal conflict, she said.\"I think the easier it is for us to try to deal with a lot of these things at the same time,\" She  said\"the more opportunity there is for us to feel this conflict between our goals.\"She isn't the first to suggest that actual busyness isn't the only thing that can make us feel busy  At the Atlantic, Derek Thompson wrote that \"as a country, we're working less than we did in the 1960s and 1980s.\" He offered a number of possible reasons some Americans still feel so overworked, including \"the fluidness ffl+-) of work and leisure.\" As he put it:\"The idea that work begins and ends at the office is wrong. On the one hand, flexibility is nice, On the other, mixing work and leisure together creates an always-on expectation that makes it hard for white-collar workers to escape the shadow of work responsibilities.\"\nAnd Brigid Schulte writes in her 2014 book Overwhelmed: How to Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time that some researchers believe \"time has no sharp edges. What often matters more than the activity we're doing at a moment in time, they have found, is how we feel about it.Our concept of time is indeed,our reality.\"\nFortunately, Dr. Etkin and her team did find ways of making us feel better about time--or, at least, of reducing the negative influence of goal conflict. When participants performed a breathing exercise that reduced their anxiety, the impact of such conflict on their perception of time was less pronounced. Reframing anxiety as excitement (by reading the phrase \"I am excited!\" aloud several times) had a similar effect.\nBreathing and reframing may not solve everyone's time problems--Ms. Schulte writes that some Americans are indeed working more than they used to. She cites the work of the sociologists Michael Hout and Caroline Hanley, who have \"found that working parents combined put in 13 more hours a week on the job in 2000 than they did in 1970. That's 676 hours of additionally paid work a year for a family. And that's on top of all the unpaid hours spent caring for children and keeping the house together.\" Sometimes, we may feel short on time because we actually are. However, Dr. Etkin believes her findings suggest we may \"have the ability to influence our experience of time more than we think we do.\"\n\"We're all going to have times in our lives when our goals seem to be in more conflict than others,\" she said.

Typically the novel is consumed by a silent, individual reader, who may be anywhere at the time. The paperback novel is still the cheapest, most portable and adaptable form of narrative entertainment. It is limited to a single channel of information---writing. The narrative can go, effortlessly, anywhere: into space, people's head, palaces, prisons and pyramids, without any consideration of cost or practical possibility. In determining the shape and content of his narrative, the writer is restricted by nothing except purely artistic criteria. The novelist keeps absolute control over his text until it is published and received by the audience. He may be advised by his editor to revise his text, but if the writer refused to meet this condition no one would be surprised. It is not unknown for a well-established novelist to deliver his or her manuscript  and expect the publisher to print it exactly as written.\nHowever, not even the most well-established playwright or screenplay writer would submit a script and expect it to be performed without any rewriting. This is because plays and motion pictures are cooperative forms of narrative, using more than one channel of communication.\nThe production of a stage play involves, as well as the words of the author, the physical presence of the actors, their voices and gestures, the \"set\" and possibly music.

However, there are good and bad ways to watch television. Parents who are interested in exploiting television as a learning tool can actually turn time in front of TV into an educational chance.\nProbably the most familiar educational way to use television is to simply watch educational programs. In particular, this means selecting channels and programs specially designed for educational purposes. Along with traditional educational shows for children on public broadcasting channels, cable television   now offers kids and adults a wide variety of educational programs, with everything from nature shows to historical events in different countries.\nCaptioning ,such as \"closed captioning\" for hearing disabled viewers provides another way for parents to exploit the educational possibilities of television.One study showed that children who watched captioned TV got great improvement in their vocabulary and oral reading ability. In addition, parents can make any show a learning class by watching television together with children. By actively joining children in the programs that they are watching, parents can help with the development of such skills as predicting and summarizing. In order to develop predicting skills, parents and children could first refer to a program's description in a viewing guide.After reading the program description and guessing what might happen in the program, parents and children could watch together to see which predictions were correct. And to practice summarizing, after watching a program, parents can turn off the TV and ask what the story was about. This kind of activity helps children develop thinking skills such as arranging events in an order and memorizing information.\nAlthough there will still be plenty of times when children watch TV simply for passive enjoyment, parents can help make at least part of their children's viewing time a more productive activity.Used intelligently by exploiting the learning chances available through various programs, television can play an instructive role in children's education.","question":"Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?","options":["Parents can simply make any show a learning class for their children.","To make watching TV a more productive activity parents should include themselves in the producing process.","Most parents have changed their attitude to their kids' watching TV and become positive to the problem.","In a way, it is how parents act that leads to whether watching TV may do good or not to their children."],"answer":"D"," question_type":"Whole-picture reasoning"}

Record-keeping experts say he was the world's oldest man.\n         His long life and that of other very old Sardinians are the subjects of a scientific project called Akea. Luca Deiana of Sassari University is directing the study. He says the name Akea comes from a traditional greeting on Sardinia. It means\"health and life for 100 years\". Professor Deiana and his team started to collect information for the study in 1997. They identified more than 220 Sardinians who were centenarians--100years old or older. His team required three documents to confirm a person's age. They were a government birth record, a church record and a statement by a close family member.\n         The Akea study has produced two major findings. The first is Sardinia's extremely high number of centenarians. The island had about 135 centenarians for every one million people. In other Western countries, the average is about seventy five centenarians for every one million people. The second major finding is an unusual rate of female to male centenarians. Sardinia has two women centenarians for every male centenarian. In central Sardinia there are equal numbers of female and male centenarians.\n         Studies in other parts of the world have shown a much higher percentage of female centenarians. The Akea study collected information about the health and diet of about 140 of the centenarians. About ninety percent of those in the study agreed to provide blood for scientific testing.

{"example_id":"high24022.txt","question_id":2,"article":"For most of history scientists and mankind in general considered plants to be passive organisms just with no reason or means of communicating with one another. But new research has revealed that many plants actually 'chat' quite a bit over their own networks, which may also indicate that your auntisn't quite as crazy as you thought. You know, the one that talks to her petunias   and expects an answer. \n    In fact, many plants form internal   communication networks and are able to exchange information efficiently. These connections enable the plants to share information via internal channels in a manner very similar to computer networks. So what kind of things do plants tell each other? \n    Researcher Josef Stuefer found that one purpose for plants having their own \"chat systems\" is to warn each other. He and his colleagues were the first to prove that clover   plants do indeed warn each other via these network links if enemies are nearby. For example, if one of the plants is attacked by caterpillars  , it will warn the other members of the network via an internal signal. After receiving a warning, the other plants will strengthen their protective chemical and mechanical resistance so that they are less attractive to advancing caterpillars. This early warning system allows the plants to stay one step ahead of their enemies. Experimental research has revealed that this communication significantly limits the damage to the plants. \n    It is also known that plants have \"family values\", with new research revealing they have the ability to recognize close  s in order to help each other survive. Research found plants from the same species of beach-dwelling wildflowers, for example, grew aggressively   alongside unrelated neighbors but were less competitive when they shared soil with their siblings. Some researchers think that plants must communicate through their roots, identifying themselves using tiny chemical signatures specific to each plant's family.\nThe research shows that our current concept of plants is probably a poor reflection of reality.

In fact, the first known lungless frog that breathes only through its skin was discovered recently in the rivers of Borneo.\nNow the same oxygen sensors found in frog skins and in the lungs of mammals   have unexpectedly been discovered in the skin of mice.\n\"No one had ever looked,\" explained Randall Johnson, a biologist researcher.\nMice and frogs are quite distant relatives, so the fact they have these molecules   in common in their skin suggests they might well be found in the skin of other mammals, such as humans.\n\"We have no reason to think that they are not in the skin of people too,\" Johnson said.\nThese molecules not only detect oxygen, but help increase levels of vital red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body. Normal mice breathing in air that is 10 percent oxygen--a dangerously low level similar to conditions at the top of Mount Everest, and about half that of air at sea level. However, mice that had the oxygen sensor HIF-1a genetically removed from their skin failed to produce this hormone   even after hours of such low oxygen.\nThese findings, if they hold true in humans, suggest one could raise the level of oxygen circulating inside the body.

{"example_id":"high5420.txt","question_id":3,"article":"What is an idiom? An idiom is a group of words which, when used together, has a different meaning from the one which the individual words have.

He is conveying the idea visually of information spreading around a widespread network, similar to a grapevine. We use idioms to express something that other words do not express as clearly or as cleverly. We often use an image or symbol to describe something as clearly as possible and thus make our point as effectively as possible. For example, \"in a nutshell\" suggests the idea of having all the information contained within very few words. Idioms tend to be informal and are best used in spoken rather than written English.\nOne of the best ways to learn an idiom is by looking at the context in which it is used. This can be done by concentrating on the rest of the sentence and try to guess the meaning. Many idioms are not that difficult to understand when considered in their context. For example: We are going to have a surprise party for Tom tomorrow. It's a secret so please don't let the cat out of the bag.\n'Let the cat out of the bag' is an idiom. Imagine you don't know what this idiom means; by looking at the words preceding, it should be easy to guess that the speaker does not want you to tell Tom about the surprise party.

Mac ran the restaurant side; Dick was the marketing genius. He had already invented the drive-in laundry and had been the first person to use neon lights in advertising. Now he spotted the gap in the post-war, baby-boom market for cheap, family-orientated restaurants with simple menus, standardized food and efficient service.\nAfter a slow start, business began to boom. By 1954, the brothers were joined by another entrepreneur, a kitchen equipment salesman called Ray A Kroc who owned the franchise to the Multimixer, milk shake maker used throughout the McDonald's chain.

Dick remained with the company until the Seventies, when he and Kroc fell out over Kroc's claim that the chain was his creation.\nToday, an almost Stalinist cult of personality surrounds Kroc (who died in 1984) at McDonald's, while the brothers who gave the company its name have all but been written out of its history. But though Kroc did not found McDonald's, he was certainly responsible for the empire-building philosophy which led to its world domination.

At first, mobile phone companies thought that text messaging would be a good way to send messages to customers, but customers quickly began to use the text messaging service to send messages to each other. Teenagers in particular enjoyed using text messaging, and they began to create a new language for messages called texting.\nA text message is limited to 160 characters, including letters, spaces, and numbers, so messages must be kept short. In addition, typing on the small keypad of a cell phone is difficult, so it's common to make words shorter. In texting, a single letter or number can represent a word, like \"r\" for \"are,\" \"u\" for \"you,\" and \"2\" for \"to.\" Several letters can also represent a phrase, like \"lol\" for \"laughing out loud.\" Another characteristic of texting is the leaving out of letters in a word, like spelling \"please\" as \"pls.\"\nSome parents and teachers worry that texting will make children bad spellers and bad writers.

{"example_id":"high13937.txt","question_id":1,"article":"In 1996, John Tierney suggested in the New York Times Magazine article that \"recycling is garbage.\" He wrote, \"The money spent on recycling programs should have been spent on real social and environmental problems. Recycling programs not only increase energy use and pollution, but also cost more money than the disposal   of plain old garbage. Recycling may be the most wasteful activity in modern America.\"\nEnvironmental groups were quick to express their disagreement. They wrote reports on how recycling programs in cities can reduce pollution and cost less than regular garbage pickup and disposal. Michael Shapiro, an official of the US Environmental Protection Agency(EPA), said that \"recycling can be good value for money, although there's still room for improvements.\"\nBut in 2002, New York City, a pioneer of recycling, found that its recycling program was losing money, so it stopped glass and plastic recycling. Other major cities watched closely to see how New York was dealing with its remaining program (the city never stopped paper recycling). But then it closed its last landfill  , and private companies out of New York raised prices due to the increased workload of carrying away and disposing New York's garbage. As a result, glass and plastic recycling became profitable for the city again, and New York brought the program back. According to Cecil Adams of The Chicago Reader, the lessons learned by New York are relevant everywhere. He believes that, if managed correctly, recycling programs should cost cities less than garbage disposal.\nEven though the benefits of recycling over disposal are many, keep in mind that it better serves the environment to \"reduce and reuse\" before recycling is even considered as a choice.","question":"Why did John Tierney think \"recycling is garbage\"?","options":["Because he considered recycling a wasteful activity.","Because he didn't think recycling was a new idea.","Because he found few people would like to recycle.","Because he didn't like the environmental groups."],"answer":"A"," question_type":"Detail reasoning"}

So our mother's characteristics leave an indelible impression, and we are forever after attracted to people with her facial features, body type, personality, even sense of humor. If our mother is warm and giving, as adults  we tend to be attracted to people who are warm and giving. If our mother is strong and even-tempered, we  are going to be attracted to a fair-minded strength in our mates.\nThe mother has an additional influence on her sons: she not only gives them clues to what they will find attractive in a mate, but also affects how they feel about women in general. So if she is warm and nice, her sons are going to think that's the way women are. They will probably grow up to be warm and responsive lovers and also be cooperative around the house.\nConversely, a mother who has a depressive personality, and is sometimes friendly but then suddenly turns cold and rejecting, may raise a man who becomes a \"dance-away lover\". Because he's been so scared about love from his mother, he's afraid of commitment and may pull away from a girlfriend for this reason.\nWhile the mother determines in large part what qualities attract us in a mate, it's the father--the first male in our lives--who influences how we relate to the opposite sex.

{"example_id":"high12844.txt","question_id":1,"article":"It is a familiar scene these days: employees taking newly laid-off co-workers out for a drink for comfort. But which side deserves sympathy more, the jobless or the still employed? On March 6, researchers at a conference at the University of Cambridge heard data suggesting it's the latter.\nBrendan Burchell, a Cambridge sociologist, presented his analysis based on various surveys conducted across Europe. The data suggest that employed people who feel insecure in their jobs show similar levels of anxiety and depression as those who are unemployed. Although a newly jobless person's mental health may\"bottom out\" after about six months, and then even begin to improve, the mental state of people who are continuously worried about losing their job \"just continues to get worse and worse\", Burchell says.\nEvolutionary psychologists support this theory by arguing that human beings feel more stress during times of insecurity because they sense an immediate but invisible threat. Patients have been known to experience higher levels of anxiety,for example, while waiting for examination results than knowing what they are suffering from-even if the result is cancer. It's better to get the bad news and start doing something about it rather than wait with anxiety. When the uncertainty continues, people stay in a nonstop \"fight or flight\" response, which leads to damaging stress.\nBut not every employee in insecure industries has such a discouraging view,Burchell says. In general, women get on better. While reporting higher levels of anxiety than men when directly questioned, women scored lower in stress on the GHQ 12, even when they had a job they felt insecure about losing. As Burchell explains, \"For women, most studies show that any job-it doesn't matter\nwhether it is secure or insecure-gives psychological improvement over unemployment. \" Burchell supposes that the difference in men is that they tend to feel pressure not only to be employed, but also to be the primary breadwinner, and that more of a man's self-worth depends on his job.","question":"Why do researchers think the still employed deserve sympathy more?","options":["They have to do more work since then.","They have no chance to find better jobs.","They have to work with inexperienced workers.","They constantly worry about losing their jobs."],"answer":"D"," question_type":"Detail reasoning"}

The simple trick works because it stops diners eating for pleasure rather than for calories. It also triggers   a part of the brain that is worried that unseen food may go bad.\nAn experiment by the University of Konstanz, in Germany, found that people who were blindfolded consumed nine percent fewer calories before they felt full, compared to those who could see. They also vastly overestimated how much they had eaten because they could not see how much was left on the plate. Blindfolded volunteers estimated  they had eaten 88 percent more than they actually had.\nScientists believe that not seeing food on the table also allows the body to know when it is full in real time rather than remembering past experiences where it might have taken a full plate to feel full.\nIn the experiment, 50 people were blindfolded and 40 were allowed to see their food. All were told not to eat within two hours of the experiment. They were then given three 95g bowls of chocolate ice cream and invited to eat for 15 minutes. Their bowls were taken away and the remaining ice-cream weighed, while the participants were quizzed on how much they thought they had eaten.\nOn average the group who could see ate 116g while the blindfolded groups ate 105g. However, the blindfolded group believed they had eaten 197g while compared with 159g for the non-blind volunteers. They were also asked how pleasant the ice-cream tasted and the blindfolded group rated lower than those who could see.\n\"The experienced pleasure of eating was significantly lower in the blindfolded group.
