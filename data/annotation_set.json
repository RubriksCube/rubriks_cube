After hearing about a remarkable new product, Jill finally got up the nerve to ask me if I'd ever thought about getting a hearing aid. \"\"No way,\"\"I said. \"\"It would make me look 20 years older.\"\"\"\"No, no\"\"she replied. \"\"This is entirely different. It's Crystal Ear!\"\"\nJill was right. Crystal Ear is different ---- not the old-styled body worn or over-the-ear aid, but an advanced personal sound system so small it's like contacts for your ears. And Crystal Ear is super-sensitive and powerful, too. You will hear sounds your ears have been missing for years. Crystal Ear will make speech louder, and the sound is pure and natural.\nI couldn't believe how tiny it is. It is smaller than the tip of my little finger and it's almost invisible when worn. There are no wires, no behind-the-ear device. Put it in your ear and its-ready-to-wear mold fits comfortable. Since it's not too loud or too light, you may even forget that you're wearing it! Use it at work or at play. And if your hearing problem is worse in certain situation, use Crystal Ear only when you need it.\nHearing loss, which is typically prior to teenage years, progresses throughout one's lifetime. Although hearing loss is now the world's number-one health problem, nearly 90 percent of people suffering hearing loss  choose to leave the problem untreated. For many millions, treating hearing loss in a conventional way can involve numerous office visits, expensive testing and adjustments to fit your ear. Thanks to Crystal Ear, the \"\"sound solution\"\"is now convenient. Almost 90 percent of people with mild hearing loss, and millions more with just a little hearing dropoff, can be dramatically helped with Crystal Ear. Moreover, its superior design is energy-efficient, so batteries can last months. Crystal Ear is now available to help these people treat their hearing loss with a small hearing amplifier .\"",

Although he played for the school's golf team, he lost the only important match of the season.\nSparky was a loser. He, his classmates...everyone knew it. Sparky never asked a classmate to go out in high school. He was too afraid of being refused.\nHowever, one thing was important to Sparky - drawing. He was proud of his artwork. Of course, no one else appreciated it. In his senior year of high school, he sent some cartoons to the editors of the Yearbook. Although the cartoons were turned down, Sparky was so confident about his ability that he decided to become an artist.\nAfter completing high school, he wrote a letter to Walt Disney Studios. He was told to send some samples of his artwork, and the subject for a cartoon was suggested. Sparky spent a great deal of time on it. Finally, the reply came from Disney Studios. He had been rejected once again. Another loss for the loser.\nSo Sparky decided to write his own autobiography in cartoons. He described his childhood - a little boy loser and underachiever. The cartoon character would soon become famous worldwide. For Sparky, the boy who had little success in school and whose work was rejected again and again was Charles Schulz. He created the Peanuts comic strip and little cartoon character - Charlie Brown.\"",

Examples listed below are four of the top ten \"\"Special New Year Traditions Around the World\"\".\n1. Breaking Dishes on Neighbor's Door----Denmark\nA strange Danish New Year tradition is throwing dishes at neighbor's door. Strangely, this makes them happy instead of annoying them. The family with the tallest tower of broken plates, glasses, cups is considered to be the luckiest one because it means their large number of true friends.\n2. Talking to Spirits----Mexico\nTalking to spirits is a part of Mexican belief. Mexicans strongly believe that they can communicate with the souls of their dead loved ones. New Year's Eve is considered the best time to communicate with dead spirits.\n3. Wearing Polka Dots  ----Philippines\nImagine streets full of people wearing polka dots and dining room tables full of round shaped food and fruits on one single day of the year. This all actually happens in the Philippines on New Year's Eve every year. Philippines believe that this will bring them wealth by relating the round dots to coins and wealth.\n4. Mistletoe Leaves Are Placed Under Pillow to Find Husband----Ireland\nThe unmarried women of Ireland wait until 12 for New Year's Eve because it is the night that can bring them the love of their lives. They place mistletoe leaves under their pillow hoping to catch their future husband. It is also believed in the Irish culture that this act will help them stay away from bad luck.\nNo matter how people celebrate the New Year, we all want to start a new, fresh year with renewed enthusiasm. We all want to be happier, find love, renew friendships, increase our wealth and also hope for a little extra luck in the coming new year.\"",

            "text": "\"For most of history scientists and mankind in general considered plants to be passive organisms just with no reason or means of communicating with one another. But new research has revealed that many plants actually 'chat' quite a bit over their own networks, which may also indicate that your auntisn't quite as crazy as you thought. You know, the one that talks to her petunias   and expects an answer. \n    In fact, many plants form internal   communication networks and are able to exchange information efficiently. These connections enable the plants to share information via internal channels in a manner very similar to computer networks. So what kind of things do plants tell each other? \n    Researcher Josef Stuefer found that one purpose for plants having their own \"\"chat systems\"\" is to warn each other. He and his colleagues were the first to prove that clover   plants do indeed warn each other via these network links if enemies are nearby. For example, if one of the plants is attacked by caterpillars  , it will warn the other members of the network via an internal signal. After receiving a warning, the other plants will strengthen their protective chemical and mechanical resistance so that they are less attractive to advancing caterpillars. This early warning system allows the plants to stay one step ahead of their enemies. Experimental research has revealed that this communication significantly limits the damage to the plants. \n    It is also known that plants have \"\"family values\"\", with new research revealing they have the ability to recognize close  s in order to help each other survive. Research found plants from the same species of beach-dwelling wildflowers, for example, grew aggressively   alongside unrelated neighbors but were less competitive when they shared soil with their siblings. Some researchers think that plants must communicate through their roots, identifying themselves using tiny chemical signatures specific to each plant's family.\nThe research shows that our current concept of plants is probably a poor reflection of reality. Scientists are eager to discover in what ways, and to what extent, plants communicate with each other.\"",

Boys and girls will have a nearly two months' holiday, and they'll leave school by train or by car to return home to see their fathers and mothers.\nThe summer holiday is the best time of the year for most students. The weather is good, so they can spend most of their time playing outside .If one lives in the country, he can go on a trip into the woods or in the fields. If one lives in a big city, he can go to a park to play.\nThe best place for a summer holiday is the seaside. Some children are lucky enough to live near the sea. But for the others who do not, if they have the chance to stay at one of the big seaside towns for a week or two, they will talk about it all the following school year.\nNow, what makes children like the seaside so much? I think it is the sand, the sea and the sun, not anything else. Of course, there are lots of new things to see, nice things to eat and interesting things to do. But the feeling of the sand under their feet, the salt water on their skin, and the warm sun on their backs make them happier.\"",

            "text": "\"American nutrition expert Professor Barry Popkin says that the number of overweight people in the world is now bigger than the number of people who don't have enough to eat. A billion people worldwide now weigh too much and the number of obese people is now more than 300 million. \"\"Obese\"\" means at least 15 kilos heavier than you should be. However, there are also 800 million people in the world who don't have enough to eat.\nProfessor Popkin says that the number of hungry people is falling slowly but the number of overweight people is rising fast. The main reasons for this are:\n* People are doing less hard physical work\n* More people worldwide now eat too much fatty food\n* Too many people are driving cars instead of walking\n* People spend too much time in front of a television\nThe United States has the highest rate of obesity in the developed world and Japan has the lowest. Professor Benjamin Senauer is absolutely certain of the reasons for this.\n\"\"Japanese people are fit. They use public transport and walk,\"\" he said. \"\"The average American drives to work and drives to supermarket. When he gets home, he sits on a couch in front of the TV and eats junk food.\"\"\nIn Britain and many other European countries, there are three times as many obese people as there were 20 years ago. About two thirds of British adults are overweight or obese. \"\"The effects of this are clear,\"\" said London doctor Elena Power. \"\"We have more illnesses related to weight and fewer fit people.\nChina used to be one of the slimmest nations in the world. However, Professor Wu Yangfeng from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in Beijing recently estimated  that 20 percent of the world's overweight people live in China. The Chinese government is especially worried about the increase in obesity among schoolchildren.\n\"\"We have a serious problem,\"\" said Professor Wu. \"\"It requires an improvement from everyone, or it will get worse.\"",

Parents, teachers and pupils, who took part in the investigation carried out for the biggest ever official review of the primary curriculum, argued that the number of subjects taught to very young people should be reduced.\nThe review, being conducted by the government's school's director Sir Jim Rose, will consider how to redesign the primary school day to handle concerns that too many pupils leave primary school unable to read, write and do maths at the level expected of them. It will also address criticisms that pupils are expected to study so many subjects there is little time for creative learning.\nThe 60 focus groups brought together 1,500 parents, pupils and school staff and is expected to heavily influence the thinking of the Rose review, which the government is promising to back. Instead of a broad range of subjects, pupils should study in-depth literacy and maths lessons alongside a more creative curriculum that encourages pupils to develop personal, learning and thinking skills, they say. Such lessons might include \"\"healthy lifestyles, sex and relationships education, drugs and alcohol education\"\".\n\"\"Child and personal development as priorities have been shamefully neglected in recent years in the rush to hit targets in the basics.\"\" John Bangs, head of education at the National Union of Teachers, said, \"\"The worst thing would be to evaluate child development through the current high stakes testing system. That would weaken the capacity of teachers to meet children's unique needs.\"\"\nHowever, the shadow schools minister, Nick Gibb, said, \"\"If lessons on lifestyle are given the same status as traditional subjects, it is the most disadvantaged children who will be worst affected.\"\" \"\"Children are not able to personally develop and succeed in the future if they don't have a grasp of basic subjects such as maths and English early on in primary school. Removing high requirement from the primary curriculum would increase the inequality gap between less well-off pupils and the rest.\"\" Nick added. A spokeswoman for the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) said, \"\"This is a summary of stake holder's view, not the views of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority or the DCSF, and has been submitted to Sir Jim Rose's review as evidence to consider.\"\"\"",

If you get a list of the heroes of a nation,it will tell you the potential of that nation. \nToday in prefix = st1 /America,if you ask the high school students to list their heroes,their choice would probably fall into three groups. The first group of heroes would be the rock stars--the people connected with rock music. There is no doubt that such people do have talent but one wonders if one should hold up rock stars as a model. The rock stars too often are mixed with drugs and their personal life is not all that good. The rock stars are rich and wear the latest fashion styles. However,one should seek more in a hero than such things as money and good clothes. \nA second type of hero for the American youth is the sports star. Again you have a person who has a great ability in one area-sports. However,too often the personal life of the sports star is a bit of a disorder. Too frequently drugs and drinking are a part of life of the sports star. \nA third type of hero is the TV or movie star. This person may have lots of acting talent and is quite handsome. However,the personal life of too many actors is quite sad and they should not be held up as a model of young people. Today,the rock star,the athlete,and the actor all have become the models of the youth in America. Really,do you hear a young person say that his hero is a doctor,a teacher,or a scientist?These people are not rich and do not wear fashionable clothes. However,they are talented people who work hard to make the world a better place for everyone.\nWhat is really sad is that the young try to imitate  their heroes. They like to wear the same clothes and  follow their styles. If the heroes of today for the American young people are limited only to rock stars,athletes and actors,the future does not look too bright.\"",

So you should try to select a summer camp for your kid so that after he returns from the camp, the first thing that he asks you is when you will send him again for camping. Let us see how you can pick the best summer camp for your child.\nSearch the Internet\nIf you browse  the Internet, you will find a number of websites of summer camps where you can find all the detailed information about the camps. For example, how much the whole camping will cost, where the camps are, what children can do in the camps and what additional facilities   they can provide. Don't forget to read the comments  of parents who have sent their children to those camps and pay attention to how they find those camps.\n _ \nSome camp organizers prefer advertisements in newspapers. Some of the organizers even invite famous people to their camps to communicate with kids. You should keep an eye in the summer camp advertisements in newspapers so that you could pick a suitable one for your kid.\nAsk for advice from your child's school teachers\nGo to your kid's school and ask his teachers whether they can give you names of some of the summer camps they consider to be the best.\nKnow the interest of your child\nWhile searching, you will come across different types of camps. They are organized according to the nature and interest of children like a music camp, a sports camp, etc. So it is very important to know what your child is interested in before picking a summer camp.\"",

When the boy was around two years old, one morning the husband saw a medicine bottle open. He was late for work so he asked the wife to cap the bottle and keep it in the cupboard. The mother, preoccupied in the kitchen, totally forgot the matter.\nThe boy saw the bottle and playfully went to the bottle and, fascinated with its color, drank it all. It happened to be a poisonous medicine meant for adults in small dosages . When the child fell down, the mother hurried him to the hospital, where he died. The mother was shocked. She was terrified how to face her husband.\nWhen the father came to the hospital and saw the dead child, he looked at his wife and uttered just four words. The husband just said 'I am with you, Darling'. The husband's totally unexpected reaction is active behavior. The child is dead. He can never be brought back to life. There is no point in finding fault with the mother. Besides, if he had taken time to keep the bottle away, this would not have happened. No point in attaching blame. She had also lost her only child. What she needed at that moment was comfort and sympathy from the husband. That is what he gave her.\nIf everyone can look at life with this kind of viewpoint, there would be much fewer problems in the world. Take off all your envies, unforgiveness, selfishness, and fears and you will find things are actually not as difficult as you think. Sometimes we spend time asking who is responsible or whom to blame, whether in a relationship, in a job or with the people we know. By this way we miss out some warmth in human relationship.\"",

            "text": "\"It's really true what people say about English politeness: it's everywhere. When squeezing   past someone in a narrow passage, people say \"\"sorry\"\". When getting off a bus, English passengers say \"\"thank you\"\" rather than the driver. In Germany, people would never dream of doing these things. After all, squeezing past others is sometimes unavoidable, and the bus driver is only doing his job. I used to think the same way, without questioning it, until I started traveling to the British Isles, and here are some more polite ways of interacting   with people in UK.\nPeople thank each other everywhere in England, all the time. When people buy something in a shop, customer and shop assistant in most cases thank each other twice or more. In Germany, it would be exceptional to hear more than one thank you in such a conversation. British students thank their lecturers when leaving the room. English employers thank their employees for doing their jobs, as opposite to Germans, who would normally think that paying their workers money is already enough.\nAnother thing I observed during my stay was that English people rarely criticize   others. Even when I was working and mistakes were pointed out to me, my employers emphasized several times but none of their explanations were intended as criticism. It has been my impression that by avoiding criticism, English people are making an effort to make others feel comfortable. This also is showed in other ways. British men still open doors for women, and British men are more likely to treat women to a meal than German men. However, I do need to point out here that this applies to English men a bit more than it would to Scottish men! Yes, the latter are a bit tightfisted.\"",

For some families, cottages have been the scene of reunions, vacations and family adventures for generations.\nIn North America, \"\"cottaging \"\" really began during the 19th century. At that time, crowds of people were moving from family farms to cities. Naturally, these people often felt a _ for the natural beauty of the countryside. Frequently located near lakes, in the mountains of woods, cottages provided a perfect solution.\nTraditionally small and rustic  ,many cottages were once simple log  homes without bathrooms, water or electricity. While in most cases that is no longer true, people still go to cottages in large numbers to escape the city and to enjoy \"\"cottage life.\"\"\nDespite the peaceful setting, there is always plenty to do at a cottage. If you enjoy outdoor activities, try hunting, boating or hiking. Many cottages are located near a lake, so you have opportunities to go swimming, boating or sunbathing around. Enjoy a picnic with your family, or build a campfire to roast hot dogs. On rainy days, curl up  on a comfortable chair inside and read, or enjoy board games   with your friends and relatives. Want to get out and explore? Take a tour of the lake in a motorboat, or visit one of the many small villages located nearby.\nMany families rent cottages instead of owning them, but for those who do, there's always work to be done. Wood must be chopped for the stove. Leaves need to be gathered and gardens taken care of. Since many cottages are old buildings, there's usually something that needs to be fixed or painted.\nThe story of cottages is one of families, traditions and memories. Are you ready to try cottaging with your family?\"",

The difficulty is that it did not take the human mind into account. The reality is that we cannot keep relationships with more than a limited number of people. No matter how hard the Internet tries to put you in communication, its best efforts will be defeated by your mind.\nThe problem is twofold . First, there is a limit on the number of people we can hold in mind and have a meaningful relationship with. That number is about 150 and is set by the size of our brain. Second, the quality of your relationships depends on the amount of time you invest in then. We invest a lot in a small number of people and then distribute what's left among as many others as we can. The problem is that if we invest little time in a person, our _ with that person will decline until eventually it dies into \"\"someone I once knew\"\".\nThis is not, of course, to say that the Internet doesn't serve a socially valuable function. Of course it does. But the question is not that it allows you to increase the size of your social circle to include the rest of the world, but that you can keep your relationships with your existing friends going even though you have to move to the other side of the world.\nIn one sense, that's a good thing. But it also has a disadvantage. If you continue to invest in your old friends even though you can no longer see them, then certainly you aren't using your time to make new friends where you now live. And I suspect that probably isn't the best use of your time. Meaningful relationships are about being able to communicate with each other, face to face. The Internet will slow down the rate with which relationships end, but it won't stop that happening eventually.\"",

I would just lie on my bed and maybe cook up some soup.\"\" Then, six months ago, she was invited to The Brighter Side -- Rockford's day care center for the elderly. Every weekday morning since then, she has left her home to meet nine other old people in a church for a rich program of charity work, trips, games, and -- most important of all -- friendly companionship.  \nJust a few years ago, there were few choices for the elderly between a normal life in their own homes and being totally confined in nursing homes. Many of them were sent to rest homes long before they needed full-time care. Others like Mrs. Jones were left to take care of themselves. But in 1971, the White House Conference on Aging called for the development of alternatives to care in nursing homes for old people, and since then, government-supported day-care programs like The Brighter Side have been developed in most big American cities.  \n\"\"This represents a real alternative to the feared institution and makes old people believe they have not left the world of living\"\", says Alice Brophy, 64, director of New York City's Office for the Aging, \"\"They do well at the centers, and I hate it when people describe us as elderly playpens .\"\" New York's 138 centers encourage continuing contact for the aged with the community's life. The centers serve more than 15,000 members, and volunteer workers are always looking for new ones. If someone doesn't show up at the center for several days in a row, a worker at the center calls to make sure all is well. And although participation in the center is free, those who want to can pay for their lunches.  \nNo normal studies have been made of these centers for the elderly, but government officials are enthusiastic. In the future, the Public Health Service will do a study to decide if the programs can receive federal Medicare money. And the old people themselves are very happy with the programs. \"\"There is no way\"\", says Evelyn Jones, smiling at her new companions at the Brighter Side, \"\"that I will ever go back to spending my day with all those loses at the hotel.\"\"\"",

In that letter I pointed out that Dr. Paul Malone will be arriving in Moscow on Monday, May 4th, and that I will work with him during that week to ensure smooth transition. My last day at ISM will be Friday, May 8th.\nSeveral people have asked me why I required Dr. Malone to come early. There are many problems facing ISM at the moment which have major implications   for the future, and it makes sense for the new director to come aboard before the end of the school year. This will give him the chance to play a major role in the planning process for 2014--2015 and beyond. The fact that Paul Malone is able to arrive in early May is good for the school. I have been working closely with him, and will do everything possible to see that he can move in easily when I leave. From here I will go to Hong Kong for a couple of weeks to spend time in my new situation, and then I will return to the United States for a few weeks' vacation.\nIn the most recent edition of the Compass(a kind of paper of ISM), I wrote briefly what I consider to be the major challenge for ISM in the future. I am sure that the new leadership of the school will be able to face those challenges in an active manner, which will ensure a strong future for the school. I shall certainly watch the progress of the school with interest. The results of the school for the past few years have been quite outstanding, and I fully expect that level of performance to continue.\"",

Instead, like so many other teenagers, Nadia, 15, is addicted to the Internet. She regularly spends at least six hours a day in front of the computer, spending most of her time reading and commenting on stories written by other users. Her mother, Deborah Konyk, would prefer that Nadia read books for a change.\nAs teenagers' scores on reading tests have declined, some argue that the hours spent surfing the Internet are the enemy of reading--destroying a precious common culture that exists only through the reading of books. Critics have warned that electronic media would destroy reading.\nOthers say the Internet has created a new kind of reading. The Web inspires a teenager like Nadia, who might otherwise spend most of her leisure time watching television, to read and write. What is different now, some literacy experts say, is that spending time on the Web engages viewers with text.\nWeb supporters believe that strong readers on the Web may eventually surpass those who rely on books. Reading five Web sites, experts say, can be more enriching than reading one book. \"\"It takes a long time to read a 400-page book,\"\" said Spiro. \"\"In a tenth of the time,\"\" he said, the Internet allows a reader to \"\"cover a lot more of the topic from different points of view.\"\"\nSome literacy experts say that reading itself should be redefined. Interpreting videos or pictures, they say, may be as important a skill as analyzing a novel or a poem. \"\"Kids are using sound and images so they have a world of ideas to put together,\"\" said Donna Alvermann, a professor of literacy education at the University of Georgia. \"\"Books aren't out of the picture, but they're only one way of experiencing information in the world today.\"\"\nNext year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which gives reading, math and science tests to 15-year-old students in more than 50 countries, will add an electronic reading component . The United States says it will not participate because an additional test would overburden schools.\"",

Eventually, they loosened and fell out, one at a time, probably about the time you were six or seven years old.\nThen we came into your life. We are your permanent teeth, all twenty-eight of us. Some people may even have thirty-two depending on those wisdom teeth in the back. Sometimes they are able to help, and sometimes they cause trouble. Many times wisdom teeth are sideways and have to be pulled. Some people don't even have them at all!\nOn a more personal note, I am an incisor, and you have seven more just like me, here in the front of your mouth. We do the biting on those chocolate chip cookies you like so much. Next to us are the canines, four sharp teeth, two on either side. Their job is to tear food; pizza is a good one for them. Behind them are eight premolars and eight to twelve molars, depending on those wisdom teeth. The molars do the majority of the work chewing the food that you eat. They do a great job on those carrots you like so much!\nDid you know we not only help you bite and chew but also help you talk? That's right. Try to say \"\"tooth\"\" without letting your tongue touch the back of your teeth. It sounds pretty funny, doesn't it?\"",

The region, which lies just behind the right ear, becomes more active when we think about other people's misdemeanor or good work.  \nIn an experiment, researchers were able to use powerful magnets   to disrupt   this area of the brain and make people temporarily less moral. The study discovers that our sense of right and wrong isn't just based on upbringing, religion or philosophy --but also by the biology of our brains.\nThe researchers used a non-harmful technique to disrupt the area of the brain. The technique produce a magnetic field on a small part of the brain which creates weak electric currents in the brain. These currents interfere with nearby brain cells and prevent them from firing normally.\nOne story described a man who let his girlfriend walk over a bridge he knew was unsafe. The girl survived unharmed. Under normal conditions, most people rate the man's behavior as unacceptable. But after getting the magnetic pulse, the volunteers tended to see nothing wrong with his action --and judged his behavior purely on whether his girlfriend survived.\nAnother story described two girls visiting a chemical plant where one girl asks her friend to put sugar in her coffee. The friend uses powder from a jar marked toxic   -- but as the powder turns out to be sugar. Volunteers with a disrupted moral compass tended to rate the girl's behavior as permissible because her friend was not injured--even though she was aware the powder came from a jar labeled toxic.\nThroughout the experiment, irresponsible or deliberate  actions that might have resulted in harm were seen as morally acceptable if the story had a \"\"happy ending\"\".\"",

The team was made up of ordinary women from all around the world--from Jamaica, India, Singapore and Cyprus--many of whom had never seen snow, or spent a night in a tent, before we set off. Our aim was to be the most international all-female team to reach the South Pole.\nBy the time I realized that my sledge was firmly stuck, the team were already a long way ahead of me. I called out to Era, my teammate from Brunei, who was next in line. Getting no response, I called again, but my shouts were carried away in the opposite direction by the wind. I had stood and watched the line for a while as it marched away from me, confident that at any moment one of my teammates would look behind her. Seconds passed. Nothing. I was gradually being left alone.\nI pushed my sledge again, my strength suddenly increased when I thought of a cold, lonely death. This time the sledge moved a little. I kicked at the ice with my ski-pole and boot, desperately trying to break the sledge free and pushed again. The sledge shot forward, knocking me off balance. I struggled to my feet and set off after the team.\nI caught up just as they realized I wasn't there. As we continued, my panic slowly faded. I found myself laughing to myself as I noticed Reena checking behind her every few paces. In fact for the whole of the rest of the day each member of the team glanced over her shoulder every few minutes. They were not going to risk losing me again.\"",

Dai Junwu with Harbin-based seismological bureau expects the death toll at less than 1,000, and economic losses from the quake could reach up to 100 billion yuan.\nPolice and expert teams have already rushed for rescue in the quick stricken areas, and the State Council has banned unauthorized rescue efforts and individual vehicles from going to the quake zone to avoid congestion .\nRescue efforts were carried \"\"timely and orderly\"\", said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang who flew to the quicken-stricken area on Sunday, the second day of the quake.

In the film, Chai visits polluted places and talks to officials and scientists. She thinks that burning too much coal and oil are the main causes of PM2.5 and smog.\nTo solve the problem, Chai suggests that we should clean our coal and oil or replace them with cleaner energy such as natural gas.\nIn her film, Chai also emphasized   that everyone can do something to help control smog too. For example, we can live a greener life by using more public transport. Or if we see things that could harm the environment, we can try to stop it. In the film, when she sees a restaurant cooking without any suitable filter facilities  , she calls the hotline 12369. The restaurant installed the filter a week later.\nChen Jining, the new minister of environmental protection, praised Chai. \"\"This film encourages ordinary people to take notice of the environment.

One reason you may not know is that people have different types. Scientists say there are three different learning types: Visual ,Auditory ,and Kinesthetic  . \nVisual learners learn best by seeing. If you seem to easily remember information from pictures, graphs ,and videos, you are probably a visual learner. You're not good at copying down what the teacher says in class. Never mind. You can draw graphs or pictures instead, if you find that works better for you.\nAuditory learners learn best by hearing. If you seem to easily remember things by hearing them, then you are probably an auditory learner. You must listen carefully while the teacher is speaking because it's the easiest way for you to learn . Sometimes you may find that taking notes tops you from listening carefully. After class, you can write down what you remember or borrow your friend's notes to copy.\nKinesthetic learners learn best by doing. If you seem to learn best by working with your hands, you are probably a kinesthetic learner. Taking notes by writing can make you pay close attention to information as you receive it. Of course, you can learn best by making full use of labs or other class activities.\nHope you learn better by knowing what your personal learning type is.\"",

From that moment on, \"\"the very last thing I ever thought about doing was taking a typing course,\"\" she recalls.\nThe show business thing worked out, of course. In her career, Mary won many awards. Only recently, when she began to write Growing Up Again, did she regret ignoring her mom,\"\" I don't know how to use a computer,\"\" she admits.\nUnlike her 1995 autobiography, After All, her second book is less about life as an award-winning actress and more about living with diabetes  . All the money from the book is intended for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), an organization she serves as international chairman. \"\"I felt there was a need for a book like this,\"\" she says.\"\" I didn't want to lecture, but I wanted other diabetics to know that things get better when we're self-controlled and do our part in managing the disease.\"\"\nBut she hasn't always practiced what she teaches. In her book, she describes that awful day, almost 40 years ago, when she received two pieces of life-changing news. First, she had lost the baby she was carrying, and second, tests showed that she had diabetes. In a childlike act, she left the hospital and treated herself to a box of doughnuts  . Years would pass before she realized she had to grow up ---again---and take control of her diabetes, not let it control her. Only then did she kick her three-pack-a-day cigarette habit, overcome her addiction to alcohol, and begin to follow a balanced diet.\nAlthough her disease has affected her eyesight and forced her to the sidelines of the dance floor, she refuses to fall into self-pity. \"\"Everybody on earth can ask, 'why me?' about something or other,\"\" she insists. \"\"It doesn't do any good. No one is immune   to heartache, pain, and disappointments. Sometimes we can make things better by helping others. I've come to realize the importance of that as I've grown up this second time. I want to speak out and be as helpful as I can be.\"\"\"",

It is always much better to \"\"tell\"\" a story than just \"\"read\"\" it out of a book, and, if a parent can produce his own as an improvement on the printed text, according to his child's actual situation, so much the better.\nThere is a charge made against some fairy tales, as they probably harm children by frightening them or leaving them sad feelings. To prove it, an experiment has been done to show that children who have heard terrible fairy stories often feel more uneasy than those who have not. As for fears, there are some cases where children get timid   by some fairy story. Often, however, this arises from the child having heard the story once. Familiarity with the story by repetition may weaken the pain of fear.\nThere are also people who object to fairy stories on the grounds that the stories are not objectively true, and that those giants, witches, two-headed dragons, magic carpets etc. do not really exist, so children should be taught to learn the reality by studying history, instead of being got fond of the strange side in fairy tales. Those, who prefer to create such stories, are so peculiar   that it is hard to argue with them. If their creative exaggeration   were _ , the world should be full of mad men attempting to fly from New York to Philadelphia on a stick or covering a telephone with kisses in the belief that it was their beloved girl-friend.\nNot once is a fairy story ever declared to be a description of the real world, but not every child is clever enough to be aware of it. Parents should choose their children's \"\"bed-time\"\" reading materials with much care. Only the fairy stories containing positive effect will make a clever and caring child with rich imagination.\"",

Psychologists at Yale and the University of California, San Diego studying the unconscious influence of names say a preference for our own names and initials -- the \"\"name-letter effect\"\" -- can have some negative consequences.\nStudents whose names begin with C or D get lower grades than those whose names begin with A or B; major league baseball players whose first or last names began with K (the strikeout-signifying letter) are significantly more likely tostrike out.\nAssistant professors Leif Nelson of UCSD and Joseph Simmons of Yale have conducted five studies over five years using information from thousands of individuals.\n\"\"The conscious process is baseball players want to get a hit and students want to get A's,\"\" Nelson says. \"\"So if you get a change in performance consistent with the name-letter effect, it clearly shows there must be some unconscious desire operating in the other direction.\"\"\nThe researchers' work supports a series of studies published since 2002 that have found the \"\"name-letter effect\"\" causes people to make life choices based on names that resemble their own. Those studies by Brett Pelham, an associate professor at SUNY University, have found that people aredisproportionately likely to live in states or cities resembling their names, have careers that resemble their names and even marry those whose surnames begin with the same letter as their own.\nThe _ , Pelham says, is that he has believed the name-letter effect would apply only to positive outcomes. Nelson and Simmons, he says, are \"\"showing it applies more so to negative things than positive things.\"\"\nThe researchers say the effect is definitely more than coincidence but is small nevertheless. \"\"I know plenty of Chrises and Davids who have done very well in school,\"\" Simmons says.\"",

For success in training children, the first condition is to become a child oneself. It means to treat the child as really one's equal, that is, to show him the same consideration, the same kind of confidence one shows to an adult. It means not to affect the child to be what we ourselves want him to become, but to be affected by the impression of what the child himself is; not to treat the child with cheating, or by force, but with the seriousness and true love suitable to his own character.\nNot leaving the child in peace is the greatest problem of present methods of training children. Parents do not see that during the whole life, the need of peace is never greater than in the years of childhood, an inner peace under all outside liveliness.\nBut what does a child experience? Corrections, orders, interference , the whole livelong day. The child is always required to leave something alone, or to do something different, to find something different, or want something different from what he does, or finds, or wants. He is always guided in another direction from the true inner will that is leading him. All of this is caused by our so-called enthusiasm in directing, advising, and helping the child to become the same model produced in one assembly line . Understanding, the deepest characteristic of love, is almost always absent.\nTo bring up a child means carrying one's soul in one's hand; it means never placing ourselves in danger of meeting the cold look on the face of the child. It means the truth that the ways of injuring the child are limitless while the ways of being useful to him are few. How seldom does the educator remember that the child, even at four or five years of age, has already had a sharp feeling! The smallest mistrust and unkindness, the least act of injustice, leave wounds that last for life in the heart of the child. While, on the other hand, unexpected friendliness and kindness make quite as deep an impression on those soft senses.\"",

In Afghanistan alone, it is believed that approximately 57 percent of girls wed before the legal age of 16.\nVarious factors drive parents of child bridges to marry off their daughters, from the community's pressure to confirm to age-old cultural customs to economic considerations. In poor, developing nations, it is not uncommon for families to settle debts by offering their daughters as payment.\nExperts agree that early marriage denies the girl education and robs them of their childhood because most young wives, burdened by grownup responsibilities, do not get a chance to interact with their peers or carry on friendships outside the household. In many cases, the girls are lorded over by their husbands and in-laws, leaving them vulnerable  to domestic violence as well as physical, sexual and verbal abuse. Underage wives who are lucky enough to escape from their husbands end up living in poverty, or worse. Most girls who enter early marriages are expected to get pregnant right away, which often leads to tragedy for both the mothers, who are still children themselves, and their babies.\nUnless international organizations take steps to reverse the troubling trend, it is estimated that over the next decade, 100 million more girls--or about 25,000 girls a day ---will marry before they turn 18.\nTo learn more about campaign to end the practice of early marriages, please click: Too Young To Wed.\"",

The UN's initiative aims to address the factors driving parents to marry off their daughters early, such as cultural customs, economic considerations, and debt settlement. The campaign also aims to highlight the negative impacts of early marriage on girls' education, childhood, and overall well-being, as well as the increased risks of domestic violence and abuse they face.

War, weather, age, traffic and pollution damage these famous places. Looking after these places often costs more than one country can afford.\n In the early 1970s, world governments decided that if they joined together, they would be able to preserve   our history. If every country paid some money, they said, it would be possible to look after important historic places. Also, if they discovered that a monument needed urgent   help, they would have money for repairs. For these reasons, countries around the world united to form the World Heritage  Organization in 1972. Today, the organization helps to maintain   and restore the most important places from our history.\nHowever, one of the biggest problems for historic places is vandalism. People sometimes enter the sites and destroy or damage the buildings. At some sites, such as Stonehenge in England, governments have built high fences to protect the site from vandals.\nThere are many different ideas about how to solve the problem of vandalism. Some experts say that if guards patrolled   the sites, vandals would not be able to get in. Some experts say that if they fixed more television cameras, they would not need so many guards. Other experts say that the best solution is education. If people learned to respect history, they would not destroy or damage it. They would also want to spend money looking after old places. For this reason, the World Heritage Organization helps to spread information about the value of historic sites.\"",

NASA says that a liter of water costs about $11,000.\nThe machine will be sent to the ISS in October 2008. NASA hopes it will recycle about 93% of all water used on the station.  Will the water be clean? Scientists say the wastewater will go through a very complicated process  . For example, different chemicals will be put in the wastewater; the water will be heated to 130degCto get rid of bacteria  .

Street art has become a global culture and even art museums are collecting the works of street artists.\nPeople have different opinions about street art. Some think it is bad, but others think it is a very beautiful new culture.\nStreet art began in New York in the 1960s. This style of drawing and writing became know as graffiti. Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see.\nOne well-known New York street artist is Swoon. She cuts paper pictures of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start as street artist. She studied art but, later, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's style. Some museums have already bought some of her works.\nStreet artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life.\nNowadays the Internet has a big influence on street art. Artists can show their pictures to people around the world. Many people in the city, however, say that seeing a picture on the Internet is never as good as seeing it live .\"",

That's how thousands of people start their day at Laughter Clubs around the world - and many doctors now think that having a good laugh might be one of the best ways to stay healthy.\nThe first Laughter Club was started in Mumbai, India, in 1995 by Dr Madan Kataria. \"\"Young children laugh about 300 times a day. Adults laugh between 7 and 15 times a day,\"\" says Dr Kataria. \"\"Everyone's naturally good at laughing - it's the universal language. We want people to feel happy with their lives.\"\" There are now more than 500 Laughter Clubs in India and over 1,300 worldwide.\nMany doctors are also interested in the effects   of laughter on our health. According to a 5 - year study in the body. Laughter improves our health against illness by about 40%.\nSo, what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to my nearest club in South London to find out. I was quite nervous at the beginning of the class, to be honest - I wasn't interested in laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking stupid. Our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands and say \"\"ho ho ho, ha ha ha,\"\" while looking at each other. However, our bodies can't tell the difference between fake laughter and real laughter, so they still produce the same healthy effects.\nSurprisingly, it works! After ten minutes everybody in the room was laughing for real - and some people just couldn't stop! At the end of the class I was surprised by how relaxed and comfortable I felt. So if you're under stress, then start laughing. You might be very pleased with the results!\"",

It was less than three weeks away from his 113thbirthday. Record-keeping experts say he was the world's oldest man.\n         His long life and that of other very old Sardinians are the subjects of a scientific project called Akea. Luca Deiana of Sassari University is directing the study. He says the name Akea comes from a traditional greeting on Sardinia. It means\"\"health and life for 100 years\"\". Professor Deiana and his team started to collect information for the study in 1997. They identified more than 220 Sardinians who were centenarians--100years old or older. His team required three documents to confirm a person's age. They were a government birth record, a church record and a statement by a close family member.\n         The Akea study has produced two major findings. The first is Sardinia's extremely high number of centenarians. The island had about 135 centenarians for every one million people. In other Western countries, the average is about seventy five centenarians for every one million people. The second major finding is an unusual rate of female to male centenarians. Sardinia has two women centenarians for every male centenarian. In central Sardinia there are equal numbers of female and male centenarians.\n         Studies in other parts of the world have shown a much higher percentage of female centenarians. The Akea study collected information about the health and diet of about 140 of the centenarians. About ninety percent of those in the study agreed to provide blood for scientific testing. The study team hope to identify genetic material in the blood that can be linked to successful aging. Study leaders say there is no single reason why people on Sardinia live so long. They believe the answer is a combination of genetic and environmental conditions.\"",

Besides, you just might save a large sum of money. College is expensive in the United States. It's cheap or free in other countries even for foreigners, so why not get out of here and come back smarter?\nMore and more American students are currently studying at German colleges. That number has increased 20% over the last three years. Living costs are about $7,000 a year, which is even lower than in other European countries.   Germany encourages international students. They create a multicultural landscape that benefits German students as well. According to a new report, Germany is home to six of the world's 100 best universities. These schools offer around 900 degrees completely in English and many German students speak the language.\nYou could be part of Finland's excellent education system. The Finns charge no tuition and offer a number of courses purely in English. They would be happy for you to add flavor to their school scene. Cost of living there is high. Be prepared for frosty winters that far north, but you will get that sweet midnight sun in the summer.\nMany other European nations offer cheap or free college for foreign students, but if South America is more your thing, try Brazil. Most of the education will take place in Portuguese, so if that is in your plan you can study near beautiful beaches and jungles. The University of Sao Paulo and State University of Campinas are both highly ranked internationally. Your money will go a long way there, too.\nMany of the lessons you will learn will be outside the classroom. Living on the economy in a foreign country will keep you on your toes. You will learn new customs, how to bargain, stay safe, budget and become more flexible with people. There is no better way to learn a language than by immersing yourself in it. At first, it will be the toughest thing you have ever done. Eventually, it will become second nature.\"",

Should school districts ban sites like MySpace?\nTeachers are worried that some students use social networking to post personal information and to cyber bully  other students. One of the biggest dangers comes from people who find out kid's personal information.\nMany districts have blocked students from accessing or using social networking sites from school computers, and some have suspended  students for posting harmful material on those sites from their home computers. Nearly two-thirds of US kids have computers in their homes, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\"\"It is important to keep in mind that just blocking access to social web sites at school is not the end of the story,\"\" warns NSBA executive director Anne Bryant, \"\"Most of the misuse of these sites takes place at home but still affects the classroom.\"\"\n _ . They say the main problem with sites like MySpace is that students don't understand the dangers involved in using them. \"\"Many students are posting personal information about themselves without regard to who has access to that information,\"\" Jim Hirsch said, \"\"Schools should focus on educating their students and their parents on how to be safe online.\"\"\nExperts argue that too many schools are forbidding students to use social networking web sites without thinking about their educational benefits. \"\"Social networking web sites can help connect students in the United States to their peers in other countries, providing invaluable lessons in foreign cultures,\"\" explains Hirsch.\"",

The first would enter the shop and make an offer, lower than the marked price. Not getting the vase at his price, he would walk out. Shortly after another would enter and ask for a price lower than the first. In this way, each of the others would offer a price lower than the one before, and the last of his friends made a great effort to attempt to get it at the lowest price. Before long Balzac himself would return, offer more than the last two or three persons made and trust to luck. The plan worked--- Balzac got the vase at his price!",

            "text": "\"This is VOA. The National Cryptologic Museum is on Fort George G. Meade, a military base near Washington, DC. The method of hiding exact meanings is called coding. People have used secret codes throughout history to protect important information. The National Cryptologic Museum celebrated 60 years of cryptologic excellence in 2012. One event there marked the sixtieth anniversary of the National Security Agency. Two former NSA workers shared their memories of operating a code machine called Sigaba.\nIn 1940, an American woman named Genevieve Grotjan found some information being repeated in Japanese coded messages. Her discovery helped the United States understand secret Japanese diplomatic messages. After the United States understood the code, it was possible to study messages from the Japanese ambassador to Germany and to his supervisors in Japan.\nUnderstanding these messages helped the United States prepare for a possible war in the Pacific with Japan. After the attack on Pearl Harbor. the American naval commander in the Pacific Ocean was Chester Nimitz. His forces were much smaller than the Japanese Naval forces. And the Japanese had been winning many victories. Joseph Rochefort had worked for several months to read the secret Japanese Naval code called JN-25. If he could understand enough of the code, he would be able to give Admiral Nimitz very valuable information.\nFrom the beginning of 1942, the Japanese code discussed a place called \"\"AF.\"\" Joseph Rochefort felt the Japanese were planning an important battle aimed at \"\"AF.\"\" After several weeks, he and other naval experts told Admiral Nimitz that their best idea was that the \"\"AF\"\" in the Japanese code was the American-held island of Midway. Admiral Nimitz said he must have more information to prepare for such an attack.\nThe Navy experts decided to trick Japan. They told the American military force on Midway to broadcast a false message. The message would say the island was having problems with its water-processing equipment. The message asked that fresh water be sent to the island immediately. This message was not sent in code.\nSeveral days later, a Japanese radio broadcast in the JN-25 code said that \"\"AF\"\" had little water. Joseph Rochefort had the evidence he needed. \"\"AF\"\" was now known to be the island of Midway. He also told Admiral Nimitz the Japanese would attack Midway on June 13.The battle that followed was a huge American victory.  That victory was possible because Joseph Rochefort learned to read enough of the Japanese code to discover the meaning of the letters \"\"AF.\"\"\nOne American code has never been broken. Perhaps it never will. It was used in the Pacific during World War Two. For many years the government would not discuss this secret code. Listen for a moment to this very unusual code. Then you may understand why the Japanese military forces were never able to understand any of it.\nThe code is in the voice of a Native American. The man you just heard is singing a simple song in the Navajo language. Very few people outside the Navajo nation are able to speak any of their very difficult language.\nAt the beginning of World War Two, the United States Marine Corps asked members of the Navajo tribe to train as Code Talkers.\nThe Cryptologic Museum says the Marine Corps Code Talkers could take a sentence in English and change it into their language in about 20 seconds. A code machine needed about 30 minutes to do the same work.\nThe Navajo Code Talkers took part in every battle the Marines entered in the Pacific during World War Two. The Japanese were very skilled at breaking codes. But they were never able to understand any of what they called \"\"The Marine Code.\"\"\nThe Cryptologic Museum has many pieces of mechanical and electric equipment used to change words into code. It also has almost as many examples of machines used to try to change code back into useful words.\"",

Girls are known to outperform boys at school, but this research showed that trend continued at university.\nFiona Smith, who led the research, said, \"\"The research shows that the difference has something to do with schools in general.\"\"\n\"\"It also shows something about the inequality for working women in terms of pay and promotion. Women work harder at school, harder at university, and do better at both, but they still receive less pay.\"\"\nThe research found that female students were more faithful, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to believe that their marks reflected their abilities than male students. Female students were also more likely to ask for and receive support from their professors.\nWomen were also more likely to choose their universities because they liked the courses offered.\nIn contrast, men were more likely than women to miss lectures due to \"\"other affairs\"\" and \"\"laziness\"\", and to believe that playing sports was an important part of university life.\nGenerally, people think that women's success comes from more emphasis on coursework, but the research showed that female geographers at Brunel did better in their exams than in their coursework.\nDr Smith said, \"\"Most women feel that getting good grades is the most important part of university life. They believe that they need to work harder in order to compete in the male-dominated   environment they will encounter at work. Good grades are viewed as an 'insurance policy' for success. Men, on the other hand, prefer going out and playing sports to academic work.\"\"\n\"\"This research shows how important it is to get all young people working hard and teach them the value of higher education,\"\" he said.\"",

Enjoy yourselves by all means, but please don't make unnecessary noise, especially at night. We ask you to respect other people who may wish to be quiet.\nThirdly, crossing the road. Be careful. The traffic moves on the left side of the road in this country. Use the crossing for walking and don't take any chances when crossing the road.\nMy next point is about rubbish. It is an offence  to drop litter in the street. When you have something to throw away, please put it in your pocket and take it home, or put it into a rubbish bin.\nFinally, smoking. It is against the law to buy cigarettes or tobacco  if you are under 16 years old.\nI'd like to finish by saying that if you need any kind of help, you can turn to the police.

For each of them there are 4 choices marked A,B, C and D. Choose the one that fits best according to the information given in the passage\nWhen top engineers in Germany wanted to build a more energy-efficient car, they headed to the natural history museum to study dolphins and sharks. But it was the boxfish  that interested them.\n\"\"We were surprised when this clumsy-looking fish became our model for designing an aerodynamic  car\"\",says Thomas Weber. He is the research and development chief for the car company Daimler. An aerodynamic design reduces wind drag and increases fuel efficiency.\nThe boxfish may look clumsy, but it can start, stop ,back up and zigzag  through the water with ease. And it does all this using surprisingly little energy. Daimler's bionic  car is modeled on the fish's boxy skeletal   system. Like the fish, the car is fast and drives easily. It's efficient too.\nThe science behind nature-inspired inventions is called biomimicry  . Biologist Janine Benyus came up with the term. As co-founder of the Biomimicry Guild, she has worked with cereal companies,sneaker designers and others to develop products based on Nature's best ideas.\nThis month ,the Nature's 100 Best List will be revealed at the World Conservation Congress  in Barcelona ,Spain. Benyus co-authored the list of nature inspired designs with economist Gunter Pauli.\nIn Zimbabwe ,a country in southern Africa ,engineers designed energy-efficient buildings modeled on termite  mounds  . The buildings use vents   to keep the air flowing and the temperature cool.\nA company in Atlanta ,US ,developed a self-cleaning paint modeled on the lotus  leaf. When the paint dries ,it becomes bumpy  ,just like the lotus leaf. Rain drops form on the bumps and roll off ,carrying dirt along with them.\nNature has done billions of years of research. Only the best-designed products have survived. Companies owe Mother Nature a debt for all that hard work ,says Benyus.\nFor scientists and inventors, the possibilities for copying nature are limitless. Technology may never be as efficient as nature, or as color1ful. But that doesn 't mean we should stop trying to learn from the world around us. Take a walk outside. Watch a squirrel climb up a tree. Look closely at the veins  of a leaf. Hear the birds chirping in the trees. Such small details may help solve big problems in the future.\"",

A nicely-dressed little girl with her father was excitedly looking through the same dolls as well. As she was looking, a boy wandered in and sorted through some of the video games. He was dressed neatly, but in clothes that were obviously rather worn. He, too, had money in his hand, but it seemed to be no more than five dollars or so at the most. He was with his father as well, but each time he picked one of the video games and looked at his father, his father shook his head.\n   The little girl had apparently   chosen her doll, a beautifully-dressed glamorous creation that would have been the envy of every little girl on the block. However, she stopped to watch the little boy and his father. Then, the little girl put her carefully-chosen doll back on the shelf, and ran over to the video games. She excitedly picked up one that was lying on top of the other toys and raced towards the reception desk after speaking with her father. I picked up my purchases and waited in line behind them. Then, much to the little girl's obvious delight, the little boy and his father stood behind me.\nAfter the video game was paid for and bagged, the little girl handed it back to the cashier and whispered  _ in her ear. The cashier smiled and put the package under the counter. I paid for my purchases and was rearranging things in my purse when the little boy came up to the cashier.\n   The cashier rang up his purchases and then said, \"\"Congratulations, you have been selected to win a prize!\"\" With that, she handed the little boy the video game, and he could only stare in disbelief. It was, he said, exactly what he had wanted!\n  The little girl and her father were standing at the door-way during all of this, and I saw the biggest, prettiest smile on that little girl's face that I have ever seen in my life.\"",

Because of his terrible childhood, Iverson became as tough  as his friends .\nAllen was always a trouble maker. When he was in high school, he was once put in jail  for throwing a chair to a white girl. Later on, he was put in jail a second time because of fast driving. When he was on the school basketball team, he didn't like practicing and even laughed at his coach. Because of the troubles he had made, the NBA at first didn't want him.\nHe was a talented basketball player but with bad behavior. Allen realized that he wouldn't win any championship or be the top if he didn't change himself. He looked at himself in the mirror and asked, \"\"Who is Allen Iverson?\"\" In this way he changed himself. Over the years, he has changed and become a leader. \"\"If you're getting older and not getting smarter, something is wrong,\"\" said Iverson.

The stranding of 198 whales on Friday was one of the largest in recent years and inspired 80 workers and volunteers to help out.\nBy late Saturday, 140 of the whales had died, said Department of Conservation area manager Andrew Lamason.\nHe said the workers and volunteers worked throughout the day to keep the surviving whales watered and covered before refloating them during Saturday night's high tide.\n\"\"We've had a really good crew of volunteers, and people have been wanting to come from all over the country,\"\"Lamason said.\nHe said the surviving whales had moved to deeper water. But he cautioned that although hopes for their survival were high, whales had been refloated in the past only to return and get stranded again.\nLamason said the scale? of the stranding has been tough on the helpers, both physically and mentally.\n\"\"It's very sad, they're very intelligent animals,\"\" he said. \"\"The common view is that it's part of nature.\"\"\nThe focus will now turn to the dead whales, and the enormous task of dealing with the remains, Lamason said, adding that in the past helpers have typically buried them in the sand, but that he's not sure what the approach will be this time.\nHe said the department had been experimenting with moving the the dead whales into the water, which has the advantage of providing food for other sea creatures.\"",

            "text": "\"One afternoon last week, I saw three tearful children from my son's school being comforted by teachers. That morning, my 11-year-old had stomach pains, retching into a bowl. Talking to other mothers later, I heard about other children with stomachache or difficult sleeping the night before.\nWhat caused so much pain? Sports day. Sports day might be necessary at a highly-competitive independent school, but not at a village primary school. For the children who can fly like the wind, sports day cause no problem. For those who are overweight or just not good at sport, it is nightmare . Even for those who enjoy running but fall halfway down the track in front of the entire school and their parents, it can prove a disease.\nWhy do we put our children through this annual suffering? Some may say competition is character building; or it's taking part, not winning, that's important; or that's a tradition of school life. I just felt great pity for those children in tears or in pain.\nTeam games at the end of sports day produced some close races, wild enthusiasm, lots of shouting -- and were fun to watch. More importantly, the children who were not so fast or quick at passing the ball were hidden a little from everyone's eyes. Some of them also had the thrill of being on the winning side.\nI wish that sports day could be abandoned and replaced with some other less competitive event. Perhaps an afternoon of team games, with a few races for those who want them, would be less stressful for the children and a lot more fun to watch.\"",

The answer is to allow them to make their own decisions.\nDifferent people have different ideas about children's decision making. Unfortunately , most parents make decisions for their children--what they wear, what they eat and what movies they watch. In fact, it's not good for children's growing.\nChildren should be allowed to make decisions when they are very young. But this doesn't mean they are allowed to do everything. For example, you shouldn't take your children into a convenience store and tell them they can have anything they want. They would be overwhelmed  by the choices. But you can give them a choice among snacks. When children get older, expand   the number of choices you give them. For example, allow them to decide the activities they want to take part in or when they decide to go to bed.\nThe next step is to get your children to think before they act.

And it's so interesting to watch them speak like a grown-up. But as they grow, these same kids seem annoying and ill-mannered if they try to be a grown-up.\nConflicts? go between parents and children. It's hard to tell who are right and who are wrong. A child of 7-8 always finds some reasons to have a conflict with it's parents. Whether it is about some toy, studies, a party or a company, there is always a difference between them. And it becomes worse when they answer you back. Scientists tell us that children should be treated with care. Yes, sure they should respect their elders.\nWe are partly responsible? for this. At an early age we encourage children to behave like adults, just because we find it funny. The kids on the other hand consider this same behavior as normal and get used to it. And when it is not funny for us any more, we expect them to stop it, but by then it is already too late. Only when they reach a certain maturity? will the children realize that answering back and being rude are not acceptable . Until then, most of the time their behavior is difficult to change, unless by force . And use of force is against the every good idea, as it weakens the child's confidence.\nSo it is one thing to bring a child into this world but quite another to make them into well mannered citizens. The best way is to be a good example ourselves, as our children are the mirrors of us adults.\"",

For example, at many public exhibitions about energy, SPS is not even mentioned. This is mainly because very little money has been spent on SPS research\nThere are people who claim that SPS is unrealistic - because launch costs are much too high today; or because it is too far away. So why do we believe that it is important to continue to do researches on SPS? The reason is very simple.\nHumans are going to need huge amounts of electric power in coming decades. Within 50 years the world population is expected to double, while economic growth will continue around the world, especially in the poorer countries. But existing energy sources already face serious problems. They are limited; they are polluted; they are dangerous. So 50 or 100 years from now, where is our power going to come from? Nobody knows. And so we believe that new large-scale possibilities should be studied further.\nWe must remember that humans have some choices concerning our future. To some extent we can choose the direction in which our civilization develops. And choices that are made in the coming decades - such as the energy sources that we will or will not use, will have major, long-term meaning for human life on earth. We believe that if research continues to show that SPS is environmentally and economically attractive, SPS will open the door to a much more attractive future for human civilization than any ground-based energy source, and one that the public will support and that young people will find challenging and exciting. Furthermore energy from SPS can be readily used in developing countries, as the SPS 2000 project will show, thus aiding economic development worldwide. In addition, by creating large commercial fund for space engineering, SPS will open the frontier of space to economic development, thus creating a limitless new field for the growth of the world economy.\"",

Is this healthy behavior?\nAlthough Russell's case is extreme, being a sports fan can be healthy for you. According to a study at the University of Kansan in the USA, sports fans suffer from depression less than people who are not interested in sports, fans also experience other effects from watching their team play. When their team wins a game, their own confidence and happiness increase, just like the athletes. Losing, on the other hand, always leads to some sense of disappointment.\nWhat about die-hard fans whose team always loses? The team spirit keeps those fans from losing hope. Knowing that other fans are probably feeling the same way also helps them. In addition, there is always the hope that their team will win the next game. Russell has lost some friends because of his love for baseball and although you may think that would make him unhappy, he has made many more new friends because of his team spirit.\nFor Sam Russell, supporting the Red Sox is not just a hobby; it is a way of life and the secret of his happiness.\"",

Some people believe that they can't help putting an weight as they get older, while others hold that if they stop exercising, their muscles  will turn into fat. Here are some more myths.\nI'll never lose weight--I come from a fat family\nWrong! While we can't change the body type we are born with, we can't blame our genes  for making us fat. There's plenty of evidence that fatness runs in families, and the main reason is that they share the same habit of eating too much and exercise too little.\nI am fat because I burn calories slowly\nWrong! Fatness is not caused by a slow metabolism . In fact, although fat people consume   more energy than slim people, they also fail to realize how much they eat. Keeping a diary can help you work out your daily food intake more accurately .\nExercise is boring\nWrong! Anything will become boring if you do it again and again. The key is to develop a balanced and varied  program that's fun as well as progressive . If you enjoy a Sunday walk, take a different mute. If you do yoga , try a tai chi class.\nNo pain, no gain\nWrong! Exercise is not meant to hurt. Indeed, pain is your body telling you something's wrong, and continuing to exercise could lead to serious injury .

However, now they are becoming an extended period of adolescence, during which many of today's students and are not shouldered with adult responsibilities.\nFor previous generations, college was decisive break from parental control; guidance and support needed help from people of the same age and from within. In the past two decades, however, continued connection with and dependence on family, thanks to cellphones, email and social media, have increased significantly. Some parents go so far as to help with coursework. Instead of promoting the idea of college as a _ from the shelter of the family to autonomy and adult responsibility, universities have given in to the idea that they should provide the same environment as that of the home.\nTo prepare for increased autonomy and responsibility, college needs to be a time of exploration and experimentation. This process involves \"\"trying on \"\" new ways of thinking about oneself both intellectually? and personally. While we should provide \"\"safe spaces\"\" within colleges, we must also make it safe to express opinions and challenge majority views. Intellectual growth and flexibility are fostered on debate and questioning.\nLearning to deal with the social world is equally important. Because a college community? differs from the family, many students will struggle to find a sense of belonging. If students rely on administrators to regulate their social behavior and thinking pattern, they are not facing the challenge of finding an identity within a larger and complex community.\nMoreover, the tendency for universities to monitor and shape student behavior runs up against another characteristic of young adults: the response to being controlled by their elders. If acceptable social behavior is too strictly defined? and controlled, the insensitive or aggressive behavior that administrators are seeking to minimize may actually be encouraged.\nIt is not surprising that young people are likely to burst out, particularly when there are reasons to do so. Our generation once joined hands and stood firm at times of national emergency. What is lacking today is the conflict between adolescent's desire for autonomy and their understanding of an unsafe world. Therefore, there is the desire for their dorms to be replacement homes and not places to experience intellectual growth.\nEvery college discussion about community values, social climate and behavior should include recognition of the developmental importance of student autonomy and self-regulation, of the necessary tension between safety and self-discovery.\"",

In the future, there will be a lot more opportunities to travel to faraway places than now... perhaps even as far as the moon. As people adventure further and further away and as planes, trains, cars, and rocket ships become faster, is it safer to have these vehicles controlled by humans or by computers?\nWhile many flights by plane are controlled automatically by machines, most people today wouldn't let their car drive itself. That's because currently the autopilot function on your car can only keep it on the same course you are travelling on. It won't turn the car right or left. It won't stop if an animal jumps in the way. However, cars today can sense when something is too close and warn the driver with flashing lights and alarms. Many cars also have GPS(global positioning systems) that tell drivers which road to take and when to turn. These systems, unlike human drivers, never get lost. In the future, it is easy to believe that your car will be better able to drive itself with the aid of computers that can determine the position of your car and the speed it should travel at.\nIn addition to computers being 'smarter' than people regarding the best way to go or knowing how close another vehicle is, computers don't get sick, tired, or angry. This means they won't make the same mistakes that people make when they are not having a good day. While responding with emotion is a good thing when choosing the best way to deal with a friend's personal problem, it may not be such a good thing when deciding what to do at the wheel of a fast-moving vehicle.\nSo what are the disadvantages of autopilot systems? Maybe one disadvantage is that a small computer problem could cause a serious accident. It could also be argued that in unexpected situations, computers might not be able to respond appropriately; some decisions require human emotions. Another problem might be that if everything were controlled by computers or robots, people wouldn't have any jobs.\"",

These satellite-based systems provide turn-by-turn directions to help people get to where they want to go. But, they can also cause a lot of problems, send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost. Many times, the driver is to blame. Sometimes a GPS error is responsible. Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two.\nWe spoke to Mr. Brown by Skype. He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. Barry Brown: \"\"And they just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in. So again, the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\"\"\nMister Brown says this is a common human error. But, he says, what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings, or failures, of GPS equipment. Barry Brown: \"\"One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn. Because they just give you the next turn, sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the overview that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place.\"\"\nBarry Brown formerly served as a professor with the University of California, San Diego. While there, he worked on a project with Eric Laurier from the University of Edinburgh. The two men studied the effects of GPS devices on driving by placing cameras in people's cars. They wrote a paper based on their research. It is called \"\"The Normal, Natural Troubles of Driving with GPS.\"\" It lists several areas where GPS systems can cause confusion for drivers. These include maps that are outdated, incorrect or difficult to understand. They also include timing issues related to when GPS commands are given.\nBarry Brown says to make GPS systems better we need a better understanding of how drivers, passengers and GPS systems work together.\"",

We can teach boys and girls based on what we now know.\"\"\nMale and female eyes are not organized in the same way,he explains. The composition of the male eye makes it sensitive to motion and direction. \"\" Boys interpret  the world as objects moving through space,\"\" he says.\nThe male eye is also drawn to cooler color1s like silver and black. It's no accident that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects instead of drawing the happy color1ful family,as girls do in class.\nThe female eye,on the other hand,is drawn to warmer color1s like red, yellow and orange. To attract girls, Chadwell says, the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boys' class. Using descriptive phrases and lots of color1s in presentations or on the blackboard gets their attention.\nBoys and girls also hear differently. \"\" When someone speaks in a loud tone,girls interpret it as yelling, \"\" says Chadwell. \"\" They think you're mad and can shut down. \"\" Girls are more sensitive to sounds. He advises girls' teachers to watch the tone of their voices. Boys' teachers should sound more forceful, even excited.\nA boy's nervous system causes him to be more cautious when he is standing, moving, and the room temperature is around 6.Stress in boys,he says, tends to increase blood flow to their brains, a process that helps them stay focused. Girls are more focused when they are seated in a warmer room around 75degF. Girls also respond to stress differently. When exposed to threat and conflict, blood goes to their guts  ,leaving them feeling nervous or anxious.\nThese differences can be applied in the classroom, Chadwell adds. \"\" Single gender programs are about maximizing the learning.\"\"\"",

            "text": "\"Half a year ago I came across a book called\"\"Salt,Sugar and Fat. How the Food Giants Hooked US\"\",but finished it only recently. I am far from being a fan of junk food,over-salty,or over-sweet stuff,and honestly this food doesn't appeal to me at all. Maybe it is related to the fact that I grew up in Russia and at that time we were not so exposed to the foreign, especially made in America foods. We knew Coca Cola,Pepsi,juice powder and Cheetos,but this stuff was not so cheap or available to buy it every day and we couldn't buy them in large quantities. We didn't know the word\"\"fat\"\"was not a bad thing but a normal of life for some people. We always had sweets and especially on holidays they were served as a dessert along with a cake. Russians like eating sweets when they drink tea. Even with my passion to desserts I still can'trelate myself to the people Michale Moss was writing about, those consumers who could not say\"\"no\"\" when it came to junk food.\nWhat I found interesting in the book was that the author didn't focus on diets, necessity to\nexercise,sleep well at night and all other things we all are pretty aware of. The aim was not to teach people how to live but instead,after having made a huge research,interviewed more than 100 people in the food industry,Moss reveals the ugly of the food business. It puts all the facts in front of us and offers a choice:to buy or not to buy. However,the answer was known at the very beginning. Moss mentions the well-known food like Coca,Cola,Pepsi,Nestle and some others and tells how skillfully the consumers can be cheated when it comes to choosing what to put in the food basket in the supermarket. We like this taste of a chocolate,the crispy chips,and sweet porridges because it was all put on test by groups of scientists who made experiments to reveal what kind of taste will be most appealing to us. It involves brain,of course. Apart from scientific researches, it was also due to successful marketing strategies and plans that people prefer to buy food.\nIn this companies'money race,the most vulnerable victims are kids. They can't tell good from bad and love everything that makes them feel good. Commercial ads of fast food particularly targeted kids and played on the fact that mothers can't fully control what their children eat because they spent all day at work. Mothers themselves buy chocolates bars and com flakes for their kids,guided by a powerful brainwashing that actually,these products were not unhealthy, on the contrary, it was encouraged to give them to kids, because fat and sugar provide energy, so they are good,right?\nGiving a credit to some food companies, they made attempts to fight the trend, but consumers,who already worked a habit of eating too salty, too fatting and too sweet products,didn't react to the changes. So the companies returned to the old policy. Surprisingly,such behavior was strongly backed up by the govermment.\nI would definitely recommend? reading this book not only to those who struggle in the battle with his addiction to fast food but also people living healthily. It casts light on many things,including how vulnerable we can be in front of corporations and their powerful and accurate marketing strategies.\"",

I was the youngest in the class, so the friendship I knew at school was absent, I put up with it for a short period. It was too long a walk on cold winter's nights and it was hard to put my heart into Shakespeare with wet shoes and trousers. So I continued reading books and started writing poetry at home.\nBy chance, I won some prizes and rewards for literature. A young woman from a TV company came to the college one day. She wanted to make a short film about me, to which I said, \"\"No, I couldn't do that.\"\" Not that I had any real excuse, I was just frightened. In the end she persuaded me that I should do it the following day.\nSo I did. They made a short film of me reading one of my poems and I became more interested in literature than ever. I wondered what I should do after this, and decided some weeks later that I could not imagine myself spending the rest of my days dealing with machines. So one evening, I hesitatingly? told my parents that I wanted to return to school. They wanted to know if I was sure, if I knew what it meant and whether I realized that if I gave up my job training, it would be very difficult to get a good job. But nothing could stop me, and they asked about the matter on future.\"",

People used to believe that science would promise a future of endless spare time and very cheap electricity. Nowadays the scientists' predictions are a great deal less optimistic: the world is challenged by climate change and decreasing resources.\nIn fact, the car of tomorrow is a symbol of hope. The emission of carbon dioxide has contributed to global warming, but the car producers are waking up to their responsibilities. Investment in new technology to maximize efficiency and minimize environmental damage is not only improving the car industry's act but also setting an example to other industries.\nIt is said that most cars of today run about 15 percent efficiency, which does highlight the potential for improvement. Get it right, and we could continue to enjoy the freedom that comes with owning a car, without the worries.\nOf course, many advances have already been made. There's evidence that the public is eager to buy cleaner and greener cars. And with petrol prices increasing there is no doubt that the cars with economical, efficient engines are going to be in great demand.\nThe good news is that we can all drive the car of tomorrow today, without having to worry about the purchase cost. By choosing our holiday hired cars wisely we can cut down on our fuel costs and experience an eco-friendly drive. Hire a green car and you'll make a difference to the environment.\nDesigners will always enjoy catching our imagination with \"\"concept cars\"\" that look more like miniature? spaceships than anything you see on the highway. Whether these creations will eventually become family cars remains to be seen. However, for the moment, there's no doubt at all what the car of tomorrow will be, and it's here today: something familiar and friendly that does its job with considerably less trouble and much greater efficiency than the car of yesterday.\"",

I was part of the team! I was in charge of the tickets sale. There were ten doors in the building and my job was to sell tickets at door number 5. I sold 567 tickets at the price of 55 \u20acuros. I could see the show from my place but the most exciting thing happened at the end of the show. The artists invited all the staff to a big party in a restaurant.

You can be sure  that I had a time of my life. Everything was so exciting about helping at this concert. Starting from sending the invitations to the most famous people in the city and calling the shots. I had to take care of other volounteers. I had to check their work and correct their mistakes. Speaking of which, it wasn't easy. Dealing with other people is the hardest part, escpecially when they're the same age as you. I think I did my best. \nAnother good thing is that I had a chance to talk to journalists. They came from different parts of the world. There were people from Russia, Germany, Brasil. That was really great to meet them and to talk with them. By the way, do you know Jess Morrow? She's a journalist from the New York Times. She's very famous and I told her everything she wanted to know about the show.\nBefore the concert started, me and my co-workers had to clean the stage, set up the equipment and make sure everything works well: the sound, the lightning and the instruments. \nHelping at this concert was a hard work but very inspiring. I'm glad that I had a chance to do it.\n\nBest wishes,\nXYZ",

He had to control his employees and this way didn't take him so much time. But that's not all... When you get on the last floor, there's a large terrace and cafe. You can see a beautiful panorama of our town. It's an unforgettable experience.

Here, in Mallorca, there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend you a unique place, without tourists, noise and crowded beaches. \nOn the east of Mallorca you will find a small and beautiful village called Art\u00e0. In the municipality of Art\u00e0 you will find a coaster town, situated on the edge of the mountain range of Llevant. Sa Col\u00f2nia de Sant Pere is a traditional fishermen village. Nowadays, you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore. Here your adventure starts. In order to get to your destination you must ride a bicycle and just enjoy the splendid panoramic view. You will ride until Ca los cans, one of the most enigmatical beaches of Mallorca. This zone is part of a protected area, a natural park. For that reason, you must go riding a bike or walking. As Machado said \u201cse hace camino al andar\u201d. It means that the most important is the way, the journey. Going on a bike near the seashore with the breeze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life. On the way to Ca los cans, you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation. There are a lot of trees called \u201ctamarells\u201d, native trees of the coast of Mallorca. Moreover, you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restored. \nFinally, you will get to Ca los Cans. It is a special beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels. There you can practise different sports. It is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fishes, sea urchins and seaweed. There you can also take a canoe and paddle in the quite sea. \nA part from sports, you should note two different culture points. On the one hand, there is what remains standing of edificatications that were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen save from storms. On the other hand, there is a prehistorical tower called \u201cTalaiot\u201d. The function of the Talaiots is not clear yet. Maybe it was a defensive tower or an important building for high-class people.\nIt is important to stay in the beach until the sun goes down. The sunset in that place is ideal and romantic (especially if you are with your partner) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Tramuntana. From that seashore you can see all the Alc\u00fadia bay, part of the mountain range of Tramuntana and the cape of Formentor. \nCa los Cans is a mixture of sea, nature and culture. I am sure that you will like it and, of course, I need to ask you a favour: Please, keep the secret.\n\nRegards,\n\nPaula.",

One of these places is, undoubtedly, Kazimierz, the Old Jewish district of Cracow.\nIn this small part of Cracow, you can meet with Jewish culture and the architectural style.  First, you should visit the New Cemetery. It was established in 1800. For those who enter it will be an \u2018unforgettable\u2019 experience. You walk among ancient, fallen tombs shaded by high trees of great age.\nThen, you really must visit the synagogues: The Temple Synagogue, Isaac Synagogue, The Tall Synagogue and Remuh Synagogue. The synagogue is still being used as a place of prayer for the few remaining Jewish people in Cracow or for visitors from Israel or other parts of the world.\nFor the history lovers, I recommend going to the Historical Museum of The History and Culture of Jewish People. It is the oldest synagogue in Poland and was constructed in the XV century. Inside there is an impressive number of handicrafts, graphics and paintings.\nFinally, you can do shopping on The New Square, a round trading hall. You can buy there almost everything: fresh fruits, vegetables, and household products. On Sundays, the gamut of products is much more bigger. If you are a good browser you may find some original souvenirs of Cracow to take home with you.\nI think the Kazimierz is one of the most beautiful places in Poland.

There are many different kinds of shopping: e.g. clothes, groceries, furniture, instruments, etc. It all depends on what you are about to buy.\n\nWhen it comes to clothes there are also different kinds of people, the ones who do it for necessity and the ones who do it for joy. The former might not be so enjoyable whilst the latter, obviously, does it for enjoyable purposes.\n\nGroceries and furniture, as well as instruments, follow the same pattern. It all depends on the type of person buying it, their personality and a wide range of other characteristics which will not be covered now.\n\nIn last place, it is undoubtedly influenced by the place in which you are buying (i.e. the room, the organization, the prices, the distance, etc) and the unknown people who are in it which may cause trouble or facilitate your shopping and make it more enjoyable. These factors will be explained in another occasion.\n\nIn conclusion, shopping might be both: enjoyable or not. In order for it to happen, a range of different variables have to take place.",

She knew she was adopted since she was 7 years old because her parents told her about it. She did not feel bad about it because she loves her parents very much and she feels loved by them. After her 18th birthday, Anna felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened to her bilogical mother and why did she gave Anna away. After finding the adoption papers she contacted the adotpion agency. She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of 'her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if her bilogical mother would be a match for a kidney transplant'. Even though it was illegal, the lady gave her the name and the contact phone number of Sara Fielding, her biological mother. A month passed by before she had the courage to dial that number. She hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother\u00b4s rejection. After a few seconds, a woman picked up the phone. At the beginning Anna did not say anything, she could not utter any sound. But then she said 'hello, my name is Anna and I think you are my mother'. After another few seconds of silence, Anna heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions. They agreed to meet the next day in the park. She was going to have so many answers to so many questions. Anna will be able to finally close an important chapter in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day.",

Students usually find it very inspiring and engaging to discuss this issue  because it is very difficult to give a clear-cut answer and so, it makes the process of discussion very exciting.  \nThere may be  a significant number of arguments which support the statement that fame is a good thing.   My personal attitude to fame is rather ambivalent. On the one hand, I personally think that the desire to become  famous is a great driving force that stimulates  people and brings a lot of benefits to others in  its wake. Sportsmen are one of the most vivid examples  of it. If  we take football clubs, for  example, we can see that the desire to become well-known and popular makes football players very dedicated sportsmen. They  can fight against the odds to be in the top league. It is remarkable how much stamina and spirit can be  demonstrated by such sportsmen. Their desire to be at the top contributes a lot to the fame and reputation  of their clubs and countries as well.  What is equally important and adds to the importance of fame is that  somebody's  desire to be famous can have a triggering effect on  others. It means that other people feel challenged and don't want to fall  behind and look  underdogs. Without  this  stimulus  they may   have been inactive.   \n\nOn the other hand almost equal number of people may   maintain  a contrasting point of view. They  give examples when the desire to become famous made people aggressive and ruthless. Such people  tried  to achieve their goal irrespective of the means. I can illustrate my words by the example of military campaigns. The desire of some country's leaders to become famous and to glorify their names as great commanders brought about wars and  conflicts between countries. Hundreds and thousands of innocent people may fall victim to the insatiable desire of such fame -seeking personalities.\n\nSo, all in all, we can not answer this  question as 'yes' or 'no' because there is almost equal number of examples that help to support the contracting points of view.

In the morning we're not used to eating salty food like salami, eggs or cheese.\nWorking people usually have lunch at about 13.00 and they have something simple such a pasta or a sandwich and a coffee because the break is short and they have to go back to work and need to be concentrate and don\u2019t get asleep!\nDuring the day Italian people drink a lot of coffee and everyone has a coffee maker at home!\nYoung people do not drink coffee: they prefer to drink Coke while eating junk food, which is cheaper and tastier than pastasciutta.\nThe time for dinner is not the same in all parts. In northern Italy people eat at about 19, whereas in southern Italy they eat at about 21. I get home late and I have no time to cook elaborate meals so I usually cook a  steak with vegetables. Sometimes I give myself a slice of homemade cake. Italian eat also a lot of fruits like apples, oranges and other fruit of the season.\nOn Saturdays or Sundays we don't have to work, so we have time to cook and we prepare typical Italian food with two or more courses.\nI really like the lasagna, made with a flat and long pasta with bechamel, tomatoes and meat and I love the pasta Amatriciana made with spaghetti, fresh tomatoes, bacon and a typical Roman cheese called pecorino. Another typical dish from the northern Italy (it comes from the mountains) is pizzoccheri which is a wheat pasta topped with cabbages, butter and typical cheese.\nEvery region has a typical food and a typical cheese. I once read that in Italy we produce 450 different cheeses and I don't think a foreigner would try them all!\nI\u2019m talking about Gorgonzola cheese, which tastes really strong and isn't very nice because it has a blue mould inside. \nI remember having tasted the 'casu marzu', a typical Sardinian cheese which has some little worm inside!\nHowever, eating is for us a tradition that puts the families together and recipes are handed down from generation to generation.\nI hope I've helped you!\nBest wishes,\n\nRoberta Trentino",

Hereby we want to create consciousness in the pupils`minds about their new knowledge. The end of the evaluation is that every pupil writes a post-it note that answers the following questions: What have I learned from this course? What did I like most about this course? How could the course be improved? Hereby we both want the pupils to reflect their learning and bring the teacher valuable information for the next time.\nIn this class there are strong wishes about certain areas regarding America that the pupils want to learn: 10 pupils would like to learn about American High School Life, 4 pupils would like to learn about National Parks in America, 4 pupils would like to learn about Native Americans and 1 pupil would like to learn about American Motor Industry. \nTaking the importance of learner autonomy and the importance of the pupils`motivation into consideration we have decided that they can follow their interests in this course.

In his letter he says that one shot from the film is the best picture he has ever made. Unfortunately, Walter cannot find the shot, so he has to look for the traveller which is not easy.

Feurer\u2019s campaign for Kenzo was one of the most popular and it defined him as a successful photographer.\nHans Feurer was born in Switzerland in 1939. After studying art in Switzerland, he worked as a graphic designer, illustrator and artistic director in London. Traces of his previous career are evident throughout his work in his careful compositions and precise styling.\nIn 1966, Hans Feurer travelled to Africa, during which trip he decided to become a photographer. He returned to London and began to compile a portfolio.\n1967 Feurer\u2019s career went up like a rocket. At the same time he worked for the Pirelli calendar in 1974 he also featured shots that appeared in Elle, Vogue, Numero, etc.   \nMore than 30 years ago, in the remote deserts of North America, Hans Feurer was given free to photograph Kenzo Takedo\u2019s 1983 advertising campaign. The career of a Somali-American fashion model Iman also began after this pioneering shooting.\nThese images became the subject of Feurer\u2019s eponymos book, lavishly illustrated with 175 photographs, illustrating his five-decade long career. The book includes Feurer\u2019s photographs for the 1974 Pirelli calendar, for Kodak and for fashion magazines such as Vogue Italia, Elle France and Nova.",

Attached to this letter of application, you will find my curriculum vitae. \nI recently completed the four-year bachelor degree European Studies at Zuyd University in Maastricht. I learned about corporate communication, about management, organization and communication and some basics of marketing, etc. Also, I have studied French and Spanish and have participated in many group projects. During the studies, I went abroad to the University of Paris where I studied political sciences and international management. After my studies I did a master in cultural sciences at the University of Maastricht. As a result of this training, I have excellent communication and analytical skills. I had worked in a clothing shop in the past, so I have some sales experience as well.\nI have done an internship at a reception in one of the best VIP design hotels in Sevilla, Spain. My duties included check guests in and out, plan and organize group arrivals, assist in cash advances, exchange money, check guest folios and give commercial information to customers. In this way I have to some extent developed strategic thinking on individual client needs. I know what clients want and know how to deal with that. During my studies, I had to make several times portfolios and had negotiation classes, so that will be no problem for me.\nI am very interested in this post, since it offers an excellent opportunity to develop my career in international management.\nIf you have any further questions, I can be contacted on 00316 12 34 56 78. I would welcome the opportunity of an interview to give you additional information on what I can contribute to Meltwater News.\nYours faithfully,\n\n\nBo Hummel\nEnclosure: CV",

As a result, I found two Ss opening their booklets and reading the original text to copy the sentences. I was lucky to notice that and I made it clear to the whole class that they shouldn't open their booklets. Also, Ss were writing the sentences individually in their notebook instead of choosing only one person to write for the whole team. I actually had to stop the whole class and ask them to nominate one person to write for the whole group. I also noticed that one team is not writing anything. When I approached them, they said they can't remember the exact words that were dictated. Another team used the words to make sentences that are unrelated to the story. Ss could hardly hear each other well because of the rectangular layout of the room. The chairs were placed in a U shape which made it difficult for team members to discuss their ideas and to maintain eye contact. Additionally, one team had finished reconstructing their story while other teams needed more time to finish the task . I forgot to prepare extra materials for fast finishers. I was lucky to remember the word search at the end of the booklet, so I asked them to do it in pairs. I also forgot to set the time for the activity.

In our country there are few different climate zones with very rich nature, various cities with old and prominent history and culture. I'm pretty sure that your journey to Russia will be a very good and interesting experience. First of all, you can come to Moscow. As you know, Moscow is the capital of the Russian Federation, it`s a very fast, energetic city with lots of things to do and to see. In the city there are a lot of museums and art galleries, theaters and clubs, few parks which priveds different events like open-air concerts or public muster-classes. Of course, you must visit Red Square, the Kremlin and Saint Basil's Cathedral. I strongly recommend you to book on-line tickets to Big Theater and visit it's opera or ballet. You know the Big Theater is one of the oldest in Russia with very rich traditions of ballet school. Maybe you remember the famous Diagelev's seasons which were popular in Europe in the beginning of the 20th century. Nowadays artists of the Theater try to keep that old school and develop their mastery. In addition,few years ago the Big Theater was restored and had gained it's original appearance. \nThere is no necessity to describe all sightseeing in Moscow, you easily can find it in the Internet, I just want to say that I'm sure, you'll like it a lot. \nAfter Moscow you can visit town of the Gold Ring. It's a range of the oldest Russian cities which were centers of the principalities during the ancient period of Russian history. Here you can feel the spirit of antiquity and the huge contrast between Moscow and provincial Russia. You will understand that people here and there are very different and styles of their lives are dissimilar.",

I would like to share my feelings about a particular friendship that is highly important to me and furthermore evaluate the reasons why is especially complicated to maintain long lasting friendships in any situation. \n\n\nFirst of all, as far as special friendships are concerned, I must say that I am not a person who makes friends easily, consequently I do not have a large circle of friends. However, I can portray a unique relationship that I have with a generous and warmhearted person. Although it is true that this is not a long term friendship I can admit that I have found a true friend. Throughout this friendship I have been given the support, the affection and the confidence to pursue my dreams. On the other hand, friendship is a two way street where you receive and give back the same favors and, naturally, I enjoy doing so. I value this friendship and is of great importance to me because it is a balanced one of a kind relationship. \n\n\nSecondly, I would like to say that maintaining friendships over time entails strenuous effort. A justification for this may be the fact that over the years people change and grow apart. For this reason not all childhood friends grow older as close confidants, simply because they are not the same people as they were before. As you gradually grow up your world expands, your personality changes and so do your acquaintances. However, the natural process of aging is not the only change we undergo but there are others such as enrolling in school, getting our first job or changing the old one, travelling or moving to another city. All this situations may impede us to stay in touch with old friends but on the other hand can give us the opportunity to make new ones. \n\n\nTo summarize, I would like to say that even thought we are incapable to remain on friendly terms with everyone we should know that the process of socializing is one of the factors what makes us human and we should always embrace it. \n\n\nYours faithfully,\nAllison Green",

The beautiful seaside and natural games reserve or Zoo makes it very attractive to tourist visitors. A pleasurable tourism is not complete without a fascinating shopping center that has several facilities.\n\n\nATTRIBUTES OF SHOPPING FACILITIES\nThere are lots of shopping centers in my town with their own unique characteristics. These include facilities like ample vehicle parking lots with very low charges or almost free of charge, elevator systems to access any area of the shopping malls in the case of carrying very heavy loads of purchases and relaxation spots like Cinemas and gaming centers for kids. In addition,most shopping malls do have enough space for their customers to move around without getting any clustering of people; as this is a statutory requirement to building a shopping mall.  \n\n\nSHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONS\nAs a matter of fact, Shop-rite is one of the best place in my opinion, that I would advise people to visit. It products are more international and they offer a lot of discounts to tourist visitors. Besides, this shop is not too far from the known natural games reserve in Lekki area of Lagos.\n\n\nAnother shopping center is the magnificent Lagos Island market. This is where you would find several shops that sell most African traditional artifact. I will rather advice tourist to pay this market a visit to enable them have choices of priceless products.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nI hope from the explanations, I have been able to convince you with respect to my opinion about the shopping centers in my town and their possible facilities that abounds as you take your time in considering visiting them.",

If I have the opportunity to help you in your organization, please no doubt that I will certainly do so. \nFirstly I strongly recommend you to visit the main capital, which is full of marvellous historical and cultural sites such as museums, art galleries, monuments and churches. Whether at some point you are fed up with art and culture, the city offers to you a lot of leisure time facilities such as concerts, exhibitions, festivals and so on! From the main capital you can easily travel by train or plane and reach in a few hours all the major cities both in the North and in the South of the country. \nAs you arrive during the summer, you should then have a vacation in the South where the beaches are breathtaking, with such a clean water and golden long shores. In connection with your desire to find a job, you should try to find a temporary job in the tourism field: as you wrote, you're searching for a monthly job and I reckon that a seasonal job for the summer would perfectly fit your expectations. By the way, a friend of mine runs an hotel in a seaside resort and I know that he was looking forward to an English native speaker who could help him with his foreign guests. If you are interested, I could give you his phone number and e-mail so that you two are able to speak about the matter and maybe find an agreement.",

Nevertheless, others consider learning  ideas and concept is the best way to  confront many academic and real-life problems. In my view, l   completely  agree with the idea that it is important to  students to learn idea and concept than learn facts. I would like to explain my reasons.\n \n  First, learning facts  can help students to solve one kind of problems that they may face. However, ideas and concepts give people competitive edge in dealing with other similar issues. For example, once I do n\u2019t grasp an idea that my teacher have explained  in class, but just remember facts.   When I do my homework, I find  the problem is different than the case   discussed in the class. While, I go back to my textbook and  try to realize ideas and concepts. I work out the problem easily. From this experience, I learn that I do not just remember  facts, but try my best to understand ideas and concept. thus, I can  solve many kinds of problem  simply.\n\n\n  Second,  learning ideas and concepts support self-education greatly. Consequently, you can reach high academic levels. It is easy to know facts from people around you. However, learning ideas and concepts need more investigation and understanding many of the academic textbooks.  .  Nowadays, there are limited time for any teacher to cover all point in  a certain subject. When, students  catch  the idea of any topic it will be easy to understand all issue related to it deeply. For instance,  when I  was in senior year in high school. I took physics class. It was massive materials on a specific issue, but I attempted my best to catch its notion that made me recognize any unmentioned points.\n\n\nIn sum,  absorbing ideas and facts is the most effective strategy. Not only do   student learn more in  their studying, but also they help students  understanding many facts in our life better than any other ways.",

I am on the point of finishing my Engineer's degree in Mining Engineering, specialization in Energy, at Vigo University. I am currently carrying out my Final Project as well as preparing the First Certificate Exam, planned for July and June, respectively.\nI would love to improve both my practical knowledge about renewable energies and my English level, and I firmly believe that the Erasmus internship programme could be the best option for me to achieve these targets. Thus, the aim of this letter is to explore the possibility of realizing an internship in your company.\nIn this programme, the trainee carries out different tasks supervised by a company tutor and also advised by a university tutor. The trainee receives a grant to help to cover subsistence cost, so the company is not required to pay him a salary. Furthermore, as the programme is endorsed by European Union, the trainee disposes of accident and liabiliy insurance. As for the duration, the internship can last from a minimum of 2 months up to 12 months, being 3 months the period covered by the subsistence grant.\nI will be completely available to do the internship from next September on. I can assure you that I will put all my effort into learning and making the most of my stay in your company. I hope you will consider my application, and look forward to hearing from you.\nYours faithfully,\nFabio",

Does it help us grow and improve our knowledge?\n\n\nOn the one hand, it is said to help people to spend quality time as they can learn about the most varied subjects from the comfort of their homes. It is possible to watch documentaries, the news, concerts, plays and learn about current affairs.\n\n\nOn the other hand, there are programmes which bring nothing new into our life. Therefore, one should not waste time watching tem. Violent programmes, reality shows and others alike have nothing to teach. In these cases, TV is undoubtedly bad entretainment.\n\n\nAll in all, it is my belief that if we use it properly, i.e., if we carefully choose what to see, television can have an important role to play in the learning process of everyone of us, and in particular, in the life of the ones who cannot afford travelling, buy books or live in an educated environment.",

But with Colton\u2019s quotation, we can clearly see that it has happened since years. I personally believe that imitation is just the sincerest form of admiration.  \nIn our current society we can see it daily. Lot of children got their hair cut as their favourite football players, others dress like their favourite actors and actresses or even adults act as their role model, just because they all do have something in common: they admire those people.\nFlattering is different, it is easier to recognize. If someone depends on you and s/he is constantly paying attention to you and being, in a colloquial way, a \u201cbrown nose\u201d, you notice and become aware of it quickly. Just because of their attitude and aptitude, their behaviour\u2026 simply in the way they act, we can see their intentions. \nNowadays, in some determinate cases, people when they pretend to get a good position or be promoted, they flatter. And we can see these examples in many situations, when we find inept and incompetent workers. When acceding to these jobs is not through civil service exams, I think there are only two ways: influences or flattery; and to be honest I don\u2019t know what I prefer.\nTo sum up, I would like to invite people who agree with the quotation, to rethink their opinion because everything is not what it seems to be.",

Tom's role was to conduct a focus group once per week to explore the people's experience and perception about their illness and the service given to them at the rehabilitation center. The ultimate aim is to get a feedback for service-improvement purpose. Tom has prepared a set of questions to ask. He started with a group of six who signed a consent to participate in the focus group. He helped them after they finished their session and took them to the meeting room. He then introduced himself and made a clear statement about the objective of the focus group and assured them that their identity will not be revealed. He started with some jokes so that they would feel at ease and disclose their experiences. In the afternoon, he analyzed the content and wrote a report with some recommendations for achieving patients' satisfaction. He felt he had done a great job trying to serve the disabled patients.",

Others, including myself, believe that shop in small stores is the premium choice. In the following essay, I will outline two reasons to support my view.\nFirst, small stores provide products with more unique feature and different selection. That is to say, most small stores may have their own logos on mugs or even T-shirts and it is more likely to find handmade products in it. For instance, my friends once bought a nice scruff with cute animal figure in a small store and I really like it after she showed me. Therefore, the next day she brought me back to the store, we found out that they did not have the same scruff because it is the only one. Although I was disappointed that I could not have the same scruff but this is the fun part that shop in small stores, you can always find something unique.\nSecond, it is true that shop in a shopping center is fast and convenient because one can buy all types of things together. However, most shopping center provide limited selections and sometimes the price is expensive.\nIn conclusion, I prefer to shop in a small stores because it is more likely to find the one and the only product while it also provides a sense of treasure hunting.",

Some assert that genetically modified technology can be applied to address this problem. This essay will argue that genetically modified food can be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increasing food yield.\n\n\nFirstly, GM food can have a positive impact on the problem of food safety. It is well known that the GM food is inserted with various resistance genes, such as pest disease resistance gene. This means that the food being more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases can minimise the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment. This reduction in the application of chemical materials can create a safer agricultural environment, ensuring food safety.\n\n\nFurthermore, GM food can also improve the production of crops. Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology, such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance, GM food can ensure the food production in the period of drought. This could be important for food production, especially in developing countries. However, some may argue that it is also questionable whether GM food has a detrimental impact on human health. Actually, thousands of tests on GM food, before bring it into markets, have been proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health.\n\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that GM food can increase food yields with the less use of chemicals. In views of this, it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortage. However, because there are some disadvantages in GM technology which is being developed, it is also recommended that governments should give more importance to the management of GM food.",

Within the town centre itself there is a wide selection of stores offering local crafts, fashion clothing, food or wine. In addition, several car parks have space for 2000 automobiles and are conveniently located on the centre with easy access and cheap rates. There is also an extensive local bus network in order to provide services to all the suburbs around the city. \n\n\nSpecial shops\n\n\nAlthough most tourists come to Pamplona for the famous festival of 'Bulls Running on the street', many become passionite about the cuisine of Navarra. As a result, a few shops such as 'LA VINOTECA' and 'DELICIUS' have dedicated to selling selected top wines and typical food. Both shops are located in 'Castillo Square' and their staff speak English. \nMoreover, a store known as 'KUXUMUSU' offers all kinds of bulls-related souvenirs and genuine pieces that explain the Basque Country's culture.\n\n\nRecommendations for tourists\nI would strongly recommend that any tourist, no matter about their interest, should visit the special shops aforementioned. There is little doutbt that they will not only find original products, but will also enrich their minds.",

Especially in a big cities, where there are traffic jams, the public transport is becoming more and more popular again. In some cities it's even forbidden to drive through  the city center without some special permission, so there is no other solution than use a public transport. \nBut what is more convenient - own car or public transport? Well it depends....When you travel with your own car you are independent. You do not have to worry about the schedule - you are a driver so it's your decision whenever you want to go or stay longer in some place. You can listen to your favorite music or radio. You are the boss. However, as a driver you  always have to be careful and watch out on the route. If you want to travel from one place to another to see different places, your own car is the best solution. It allows you to see much more in your pace. \nBut think about the costs. Think how much you pay for a petrol nowadays. Consider as well how many days do you have for vacations. Maybe cheap airlines are better? \n\n\nBeing back to our everyday life. Most of us are living in a big cities and face problems with the traffic. What if we use the public transport to get to work? Well, then you don't have to worry about the parking space and you can read more books on the way to work. Simply, you can use the way to work as an additional time for yourself. What else? After work you can go for a drink with your colleagues! And if the ecology is important for you just think about the pollution. \n\n\nLet's reflect one again: is there a future for public transport? In my opinion: yes, there is! Is travelling by car more convenient? Well, it depends!",

In contrast, in Taiwan, we have our own currency and the government is efficient and well-organized. Clearly, Taiwan will not be the next Greece.\n\n\nMonetary policy could be a very useful short term financial tool for a government to stimulate its worsening economy, and, from the empirical experience, many countries have successful applied such policy. In 2012, Japanese central bank unprecedented depreciated Yuan, which has obviously improved its exports and recovered its economy from stagnation. Obviously, Taiwan has its own currency, new Taiwan dollar, and if Taiwan\u2019s economy is worsening someday, Taiwanese government could simply mimic what Japanese government did in 2012.\n\n\nNot only Taiwan is different from Greece in currency sovereignty, it also wins in government\u2019s efficiency. According to a global survey, Taiwan wins reputation in effectiveness, in which Taiwan government has legislated severe laws to prevent corruption. Therefore, Taiwanese have to pay taxes by regulation and do not dare to evade taxes. Without a doubt, the efficacy of Taiwanese government is beneficial to people\u2019s welfare.\n\n\nAll in all, Taiwan has currency sovereignty and is well-known for its effectiveness. Therefore, Taiwan would not be sunk down like Greece. As a country, Taiwan has to stick to its ordinary path to create lovely and healthy environment to its civilians.",

From the Red Square you can easily see Moscow Kremlin, St. Basils Cathedral, the State Historical Museum and Gum Trading House. If you are dying of hunger you can have a quick snack at Teremok cafe or have a square meal at the restaurant #57, which on the the third floor of the Gum. \nI prefer spending my free time in the parks. Gorky Park is my favorite place for my leisure. It's a capital's central park where you'll wind lots of interesting affairs. There are lots of facilities such as sports centre, ping pong club, hire centre etc. There is an open-air cinema, but it opens only after 10.00 PM. \nSo, if you want to have a memorable holiday, the capital of Russia is the most attractive place.",

One of the major reasons for this problem is wars especially in the Arab countries like Syria, Libya and Yemen.Everyday on news We see the refugees who are in a miserable condition.They live in tents that do not protect them of cold weather or dangerous insects. They do not have enough food.In addition , financial crisis ,almost of the  companies has a financial problem so the ideal solution for them is downsizing. After a while the people who are laid off will not have enough money to live ,and they will become homeless people.Furthermore, children street  is a result of families troubles.Cases of divorce are increasing and many children escape and prefer to live in the street instead of home full of problems.  \n\n\n  As opposed to the idea above, some people believe that homeless people are criminals and they cause danger on our society because they need money and food so they can steal or kill for this.\n\n\n  To conclude, the world has a complicated issue,so The governments and the charitable organization must take a quick decision and put a real solution to solve this problem.The homeless people are human beings and they must take their rights in life.",

Smith\n\n\nI would like to apply for the job as a security guard for the Openair Frauenfeld as advertised in your Facebook-post from the 18th of July. \n\n\nMy name is Michael Freeman and I'm twenty-nine years old. I've been working as a security guard in a lot of places around the world. I was in a position of a leader for a Katie Perry concert and I worked for Angela Merkel when Fran\u00e7ois Hollande arrived in Berlin.\nI was a paramedic in first place but then I wanted to change something in my life and combined my hobby, which is going to the gym, and became a security. With these experiences I can safely escort people, which are knocked out or a bit ill and can't stand the concert anymore, out of a concert and help them. I have a degree in English and I can speak German and Spanish fluently. I haven't got a family so I am independent and able to work wherever I can.\n\n\nI feel I have the right experiences and attitude to be a great member of the crew and I hope you will consider my application favorably. \n\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nYours sincerely,\n\n\nMichael Freeman",

Inocencio, surprised by this discovery, asked to his partners in the Order of Saint Bartolo about the taste of their blood, incredibly, after a needlestick in their fingers, all the priests from the congregation agreed that their blood did not taste like the wine converted in Holy blood at the church.\nAt that time, the Order sent to Vatican an urgent message and called the press for making the announcement of the discovery.

A better future means having good food to eat without worrying, good clothes to wear, a big property, a private means of transportation and many more. Among them a private means of transportation suggests that there is no future for public transport. It is already in practice in western world. People from other parts of the world are also heading for the same dream. Having own car or means of transportation is the dream of every individual including me. A single car will not be enough for a family. Private care per individual is needed. It has also become a vital thing for life. Whether to go to work or other places travelling in private vehicle is hassle free. It saves lot of our time. We can indulge in many things if we can manage time properly. The trend of personal car is increasing rapidly. So, I believe that there is no future for public transport. We cannot deny that there will be time when no person would like to travel by bus or train. It is so much clear that private transport will overshadow the public vehicles.",

Bydgoszcz is my family city and destination of this journey.\n  Sadly our car was crushed... in big and busy intersection! This wasn't some big, we still had four wheels and motor, but electronics in car stopped worked. This was very scared! We weren't have speedometer, blinkers and lights, it was very dangerous situation. We were stopped on the side and looked for solution. My father was rung for friends but unfortunately no one could help us. We must took risk and went to nearest market. In parking in front of this building very nice and crazy old man was helped us and charged acumulator in our car. This was worked and we could backed to drove. We were very scared because car could crushed again at any moment. For this reason we weren't using a motorway.\n  Fortunetly we were backed to home healthy and happy but very very tired.",

I am looking for a job in the USA to improve my English and to gain more experience working with children as I want to become a primary school teacher.\n\n\nI have babysat children of different ages for the last 4 years and have found that so far very satisfying. In addition, I have privately coached  5th and 6th grade pupils in Mathematics, English, German and French for the last 3 years. The people I have worked for find me a reliable, communicative, well-organised and cheerful person. I have been told that I am quite good with children. My babysitting duties were to bring the children to bed, provide lunch or dinner, play with and read to them. With regard to the tutorials. I have put together my own exercise material, looked and discussed class tests and helped the pupils with their homework.\n\n\nSince I worked twice as a group instructor at a local summer camp, I think that I am well-equipped to deal with 8-12 year old children from the experience I mentioned.\n\n\nI hope you will invite me for a job interview, via Skype or in in person and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\nTessa Foerster",

This speaks of the idea of the government or another organization having the control over houses and their furniture and making the people living there only the owners of their own goods. This is an interesting concept because it can give the government the money it needs to solve its other problems and doesn\u2019t necessarily break any rule of personal space.\nSecond of all, as I did say \u201cto a certain degree\u201d, the idea of controlling one\u2019s own choices regarding house picking and what they can do with them takes away a bit of their freedom, which is the complete opposite of what we should get to. Mankind has always strived for freedom in one way or another, and taking away the control of their own house, their sanctuary, will not be taken lightly by them.\nIn conclusion, I cannot tell whether or not the control of the people\u2019s houses and furniture will bring any help in today\u2019s society, as we are only hypothetically speaking, without any form of testing, however it does have its strong and weak points.",

CLIL implementation is always a challenge for the teacher, but it seems to be even more difficult when talking about subjects as Arts and Crafts which are more based on the acquisition of skills and the development of another language, the artistic. How to provide student with more real and relevant input, in the daily routine of an art class, seems to be a dare for Arts and Crafts teachers, who need to bring together the development of the artistic language and the learning of a foreign language. \n\n\nDespite the difficulties that CLIL teachers have to overcome, the truth is that the atmosphere of CLIL lessons is in some way special. What surprised me more positively was the level of peer support, the cooperation and the comradeship. It is interesting to see how the students resort each other looking for help in a natural way, without the intervention of the teacher. Peer support is something that teachers expect and promote in all subjects, but it seems to emerge more genuinely when talking about CLIL atmosphere.",

There's not much work you have to do on a normal day, but maybe this will be a special one, because of the match between Celta and Real Madrid that is going to be celebrated half a kilometre away.\n\n\nFirst, you need to know how to open the establishment. I asked for my right-hand employee David to come earlier due to your arrival. He'll be in front of the place at 8.30, just 15 minutes earlier than we open the doors. The problem is David's shift ends at 14:00, so he won't be with you in the evening, when we usually lock up at 20:00. Once you close it, it would be great if you could let the keys in David's house, which is in the same building.\n\n\nThere is about 14 workers in the shop, divided in 2 groups with different schedule each one. They have similar skills and productivity, but, honestly, I prefer working with the morning one. I don't think you'll have any problem with both groups. \n\n\nIf there is any problem with the cash registrer (very common, actually), you have a phone number under it of a good technician. The bill will be assumed by us.\n\n\nWrite back soon and let me know if you have any concern.\n\n\nAll the best\n\n\nAlberte",

All the participants, which were ten in total, were given a personal computer for the duration of the entire course in order to put into practice what was taught. Furthermore, the organizers had carefully planned the whole course, including meals and beverages too.\n\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n\n\nThe tutor, Will Reeves - a lecturer of the University of Cambridge, succeeded in covering the whole program in an extremely effective way. To begin with, he focused on design considerations with DPT, explaining what software to use, and then he went on to tell us about typography and fonts, layout and balance as well as graphics and logs. Therefore, he concluded the course by making color considerations and showing proofing and printing. The highpoint, however, was the final practical exercises which gave us the opportunity to test our comprehension. \n\n\nFAILURES\n\n\nDespite the strengths mentioned above, there were also some areas that required some attention. Not only was the venue inconvenient but it was also dirty. The general dissatisfaction was perceived by the lecturer too, who pointed it out to the organizers who immediately started looking for an alternative venue. In addition, in spite of having paid a lot, the participants were not allowed to take any materials away, and this resulted in obtaining a less effective result as the participants didn\u2019t have any materials to use to revise. \n\n\nFINAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n\nTo sum up, the course was generally successful, as the positive feedback received suggests. In conclusion, we would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in this subject for both the quality of the course and the unquestionable preparation of the tutor.",
