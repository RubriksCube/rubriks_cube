# Write and Improve (WandI) Essay Scoring Dataset

The W&I corpus contains submissions (defined as *essays*) that have been manually annotated with a coarse Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) level by trained raters. 
Levels correspond to language proficiency levels ranging from A1 (elementary) to C2 (complete proficiency) from a second-language learnerâ€™s perspective.

This task was originally framed as a classification task. For the purposes of this research, we adapted it to follow an MCQ (multiple-choice question) format, where the `context` is the essay, and each of the CEFR levels is listed as answer `options`.

For example

```
