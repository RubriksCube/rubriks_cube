# RACE Dataset
RACE data is grouped by difficulty (RACE-M: middle school; RACE-H: high school). To better understand the dataset, authors subdivided questions into five reasoning categories. For the purpose of this research, we only focused on three: *Detail Reasoning*, *Whole Picture Reasoning*, and *Attitude Analysis*.
Below is a brief description for each:
- **Detail Reasoning**: Answers to these questions cannot simply be found by matching the questions to the reading passages and require test-takers to provide reasons for their choices.
- **Whole Picture Reasoning**: These questions test the studentsâ€™ overall understanding of a story.
- **Attitude Analysis**: These questions ask about the opinions or attitudes of the author or characters of the reading passages.

# Distribution of instances

| Question type | Base set | Ann set |
| ------------- | ----|----|
| Detail reasoning | 400 | 36 |
| Whole Picture reasoning | 400 | 37 |
| Attitude Analysis | 200 | 37 |
| Total | 1000 | 110 |

For detailed information on how the instances were selected to create the *base* and *annotation* sets, refer to section `B.3 Reading comprehension` in the paper's appendix.
